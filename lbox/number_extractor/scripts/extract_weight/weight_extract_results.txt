Throughput capacity typically ranges from 500 to 1500 kg
Values between 2 and 7 litres of water per kg
leave the final mangle of the scouring line with a moisture content of approximately 0.8 litres per kg
The scourers at the bottom end of this range ( Mill H , 13 kg / tonne and Mill L , 8 kg
At the top end of the range is Mill E , which recovers 71 kg
The remaining mills , wholly or predominantly fine wool scourers , recover between 22 and 42 kg
The seven users of alcohol ethoxylates consume an average of 9.1 g detergent per kg
whilst the five users of alkylphenol ethoxylates use an average of 8.0 g detergent per kg
The survey shows that the fine wool scourers use an average of 7.5 g detergent per kg
ated , using the data available , by considering : ¬∑ the amount of COD contained in the raw wool ( 556 kg

es and associated output of COD and sludge Discharges from the mills vary widely , from zero to 73 kg
Sludge production ( dry basis ) ranged from about 100 to 300 kg
Heating 1 kg
COD emission factors for the three selected mills range from 20 to 30 kg
equirements for yarn dyeing can therefore be defined as follows : ¬∑ yarn package dyeing ( heating 10 kg

The input of chemicals and auxiliaries added at the finishing mills can be up to 1 kg

The evaporation / incineration process produces 20 g of ash per kg

In the study , the field received annual applications of 150 kg
N2O Emissions over the same period showed a pronounced diurnal cycle and totalled 4.7 kg
In 2005 , the two biosolids treatments produced highest yields ( 10,786 and 10,848 kg
respectively ) followed by the limed and fertilized tailings ( 8,466 kg ha-1 ) .
e soil reconstruction methods were much lower in yield than the unmined prime farmland soils ( 14,361 kg
Corn yields in 2007 showed poor performance on biosolids ( 3,449 - 3,637 kg
However , this contribution is estimated to be , on average , only 0.4 kg

In Ontario , the amount of N lost remained fairly constant with a range of 14.4 kg
Plots established in 2006 on a Clarion loam showed that applying 34 kg

Soils within 1.5 km of the zinc smelter accumulated high levels of Zn ( 508 mg kg
Black carbon in ponderosa soils was 9 kg
For lodgepole soils , BC was 5 kg
Treatments include a lime and fertilizer control ( 196 kg
mposted poultry manure ( 1051 and 2102 kg P ha-1 added ) , and two blends of fresh poultry manure ( 1051 kg
Fertilizer addition increased Mehlich-3 extractable P to 120 mg kg
Despite the large increase in soil test P , P leached remained low at 1 to 2 kg
K losses were small compared to fertilizer inputs , although winter losses of K sometimes exceeded 30 kg
