ifugal extraction Drained hanks from the dyeing machine can contain ( in the case of wool ) up to 0.75 kg
Throughput capacity typically ranges from 500 to 1500 kg
Values between 2 and 7 litres of water per kg
leave the final mangle of the scouring line with a moisture content of approximately 0.8 litres per kg
The scourers at the bottom end of this range ( Mill H , 13 kg / tonne and Mill L , 8 kg
At the top end of the range is Mill E , which recovers 71 kg
The remaining mills , wholly or predominantly fine wool scourers , recover between 22 and 42 kg
The seven users of alcohol ethoxylates consume an average of 9.1 g detergent per kg
whilst the five users of alkylphenol ethoxylates use an average of 8.0 g detergent per kg
The survey shows that the fine wool scourers use an average of 7.5 g detergent per kg
ated , using the data available , by considering : · the amount of COD contained in the raw wool ( 556 kg
COD content of fine wool 556 kg
es and associated output of COD and sludge Discharges from the mills vary widely , from zero to 73 kg
Sludge production ( dry basis ) ranged from about 100 to 300 kg
Heating 1 kg
COD emission factors for the three selected mills range from 20 to 30 kg
equirements for yarn dyeing can therefore be defined as follows : · yarn package dyeing ( heating 10 kg
15 kg of water per kg of textile ) : 6.3 GJ · yarn drying ( water content when entering the dryer : 0.5 kg
The input of chemicals and auxiliaries added at the finishing mills can be up to 1 kg

The evaporation / incineration process produces 20 g of ash per kg
It is assumed that a conventional scourer discharging 10 litres of water per kg

The remaining portion is partly emitted in the exhaust air ( 0.01 kg
Typically plants with 250 kg
capital investment required for a solvent scouring line ( and ancillary plant ) with a capacity of 500 kg
Evaporation requires approximately 0.3 kg
This corresponds to 1.0 kg steam / kg of recovered NaOH at 28 ° Bé or 1.85 kg

Thus , in conventional systems the loss per supply system is up to 8 kg
the loss is reduced from 4.3 kg ( in the case of a non - optimised printing paste supply system ) to 0.6 kg
Therefore , the 3.7 kg

For optimum performance , exhaust humidity should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.15 kg

So , for example , a liquor ratio of 1:10 means 10 litres of water on 1 kg
