    "The purpose of this anlaysis is trying to find the products that most likely make people happy, based on the happy moments in the dataset. We use KOKO, an entity extraction system with a declarative query language, to extract products (e.g., car, dress) that we believe contribute to happiness. KOKO is especially suitable for entity extraction with limited evidence (e.g. cafe name extraction from one or a few blogs). To use KOKO, the user specifies a few high-level patterns along with weights and KOKO will find all instances matching against the patterns, and return the most proabable results based on the accumulated weights for each entity.\n",

    "1. Data preprocessing: the dataset is read and converted to a text file as input to KOKO\n",
    "2. Information extraction: a KOKO query is written and evaluated. The query specify the desirable patterns entities match against."
