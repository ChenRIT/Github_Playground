I found a silver coin from 1852 buried in the sand of CapAo da Canoa beach, located in southern Brazil.
This one is pretty minuscule, we had to go to the laundromat today and obviously I had all three of my kids with me, my 5 year old, my 2 year old and my 5 month old. Last time we had to go they were all butts, my 5 month old wanted to scream the whole time and my two girls were all over the place. Today they were basically perfect, my 5 month old stayed content in his car seat with his toys and I tried to make it more fun for my girls so after getting the clothes in the dryer we went and got drinks and they just sat patiently waiting with minimal outbursts. It was nice to get laundry done in some peace and I really appreciated the fact that some part of them realized that this needed to get done. 
The word problem is never part of a happy personas vocabulary. A problem is viewed as a drawback, a struggle, or an unstable situation while a challenge is viewed as something positive like an opportunity, a task, or a dare. Whenever you face an obstacle, try looking at it as a challenge.

We went to my cousinas wedding. It was a lovely wedding very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.

The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.

You may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didnt go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.

But all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family.  The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts.  All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies.  Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years.  SNAFUs still abound.  My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian.  How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.

They openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife.  Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else.  Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of three| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok.  There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.

My childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing.  The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments.  As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places.  My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.

My cousin and his new wife are very nice people.  I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together.  And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, that's not such a bad thing.
The time i meet my friends outside in the evening walktime .I and my friends narrated the whole day enjoyable and sorrowfull moments of the day.After that share jokes and comments on the way.I am happy on the road side natural sceneries and the snacks of the roadside.
Hearing Songs It can be nearly impossible to go from angry to happy, so you're just looking for the thought that eases you out of your angry feeling and moves you in the direction of happiness. It may take a while, but as long as you're headed in a more positive direction youall be doing yourself a world of good.
My new BCAAs came in the mail. Yay! Strawberry Lemonade flavored aminos make my heart happy.
There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesn't come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions
Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority. If you think someone else is better than you, you end up feeling bad about yourself. Youall be happier if you focus on your own progress and praise others on theirs.
I could do 108 suryanamaskars in 40 mins for which I would otherwise take 60 mins!!

This is the second essay in a two-part series about my journey to visit the Taj Mahal. Read the first part for the whole story.

A
GRA, Uttar Pradesh, India a As soon as my train to Agra leaves from Delhi, I find myself confused again. Iam lying on my reserved upper berth, though most of the train car beds arenat being used and almost all of the passengers are sitting on lower seats. I feel ridiculous, like Iam emperor of my train car, overseeing the rest of the passengers from above. Meanwhile, men pass by below me, offering a mysterious vegetarian curry out of industrial-sized buckets. I motion for one to serve me some on a paper plate, but when I try to pay for the food, he wonat accept any money. This is the first time Iave gotten anything for free in India. I conclude that the food is going to kill me.

While Iam eating, the train makes a stop and passengers disembark, but the conductor makes no announcements. I canat see through any of the trainas tiny lower windows from my upper bunk. I have no idea where I am.

aIs this Agra?a I ask a man sitting below me. I ask as nicely as possible, in an attempt to avoid appearing as a self-righteous train car emperor, shouting questions to my serfs. After all, I remember, Taj Mahal-builder and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son soon after the Taj Mahalas completion. The man below shakes his head and, in Hindi, I think he tells me that we still have a long ride to Agra. Another man walks by selling non-vegetarian food in foil tins. The first shots of an intestinal war have already been fired as a result of my free bucket food, so I decline. As the train chugs toward Agra, stopping at stations along the way, I find myself continuously recruiting new serfs below me to keep track of where we are. By the time Iam halfway through the journey, I have an eighteen year old kid, two Indian soldiers, and a young woman a none of whom can speak English a trying to assist me. Itas easy to accidentally aggregate helpers on the train; mercifully, Indians tend to be especially protective of clueless Westerners trying to make sense of Indian public transportation. At one point, the two Indian soldiers demand that a teenager move his feet resting on my berth, and the young woman makes food recommendations as buckets whisk by. Theyare kind of like four Train-Fairy Godmothers. Soon, I fall asleep.

Suddenly, I awake to the sound of four Indians chanting aAgra! Agra!a in unison. I abruptly end my time as train car emperor, jump down from my bed, thank the four of them, and catch a taxi to my Agra guesthouse. Before he leaves, I arrange for my taxi driver to pick me up at 6 AM the next morning to take me to the Taj Mahal.

In the morning, I tell my driver to take me to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. He promptly takes me to a roundabout near the West Gate instead a though his aEast Gate!a announcement upon our arrival is quite convincing. Indiaas perpetually dishonest taxi drivers always have ulterior (and sometimes mysterious) motives; in this case, he was trying to save gas by taking me to the Gate closer to my hotel and, according to Lonely Planet, possibly collect a kickback from camel and rickshaw drivers sitting near the West Gate waiting to take tourists to the Tajas ticket office. I donat bother to argue with him since thereas not much time until sunrise, and I walk quickly to the entrance. Standing in line with about twenty other mostly Indian tourists, Iam surprised to see a lack of Westerners a I imagined that every white person in India would be flocking to the Taj Mahal.

Finally, the doors open, and I catch my first glimpse of the building considered to be the most beautiful in the world, one whose creator boasted that it made athe sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.a I see the famous white, marble dome peeking through the arch of the Great Gate as tourists hold cameras high above their heads to get their first snapshot. I walk deliberately toward and around the Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle. A handful of photographers gather in front of the adjacent Taj Mahal mosque with me to capture the sun as it rises behind it. Everyone is reverent, taking care not to interfere with othersa photographs and offering to help take posed pictures. The moment is perfect for the photographer gaggle: mist blankets the Yamuna River behind the structure, and the building looks like it has risen spontaneously from a clouded heaven, a concrete manifestation of nirvana.

The simple presence of the Taj, built as a symbol of eternal love by Emperor Jahan in memory of his third wife who died during childbirth, seems to encourage even rabid photographers to cooperate with each other.

I spend almost two hours touring and photographing the Taj, walking around its walls, admiring the calligraphy on the entrance arch, gazing at the minarets, and touching the intricate lattice screens in the mausoleum interior. Iam just about finished, taking a few final classic Taj Mahal reflection pool photographs from outside, when a beautiful, young blond woman performing playful, provocative poses for her friends camera catches my eye. Soon, a string of Indian men, and some Indian families too, start interrupting to ask her to pose with them in souvenir photos.

aThe Indian tourists seem more interested in your white skin and blond hair than the white marble of the Taj Mahal,a I say to her. aIam pretty sure a lot of these Indian guys are leaving with more pictures of you than the Taj.a

She chuckles and introduces herself to me as Sophie, from France, and, quickly, weare trading funny stories of our travels through India. We like each other immediately. We find ourselves chatting in front of the Tajas reflection pool for about a half hour as Indian men gawk at us. But when Sophie and I realize that weare headed in opposite directions a she toward Amritsar in northern India and me toward Kerala in southern India a we share an awkward moment during which we realize that this is the one and only meeting of our entire lives.

well, it truly has been a pleasure, Hank,a she says. Her eyes hold on mine. For a long moment, she doesnat look away. I canat tell whether sheas staring at me or at the exquisite reflection of the Taj Mahal in the pool behind me.

She walks past me, in front of the rising sun. Then, she glances back at me one last time, smiles, and then shifts her gaze, once again, toward the world's most beautiful symbol of eternal love.
This is a great way to sum up the feeling of happiness, itas when everything feels like itas clicking, and itas all in sync. When any part of this equation breaks down, you start to lose the handle on your happy feelings. Thatas why itas important to always speak your true feelings, and act according to the way you're feeling inside. 
I have given a aadhar card update to a poor man with a minimum cost, the same moment he felt very happy.
 It may take a while, but as long as youare headed in a more positive direction you'll be doing yourself a world of good.

 Going against your internal system for guidance is a sure way to feel less than perfectly happy. Always strive for a lining up of these three aspects for a happy life.
I finished  up my  mturk work a  bit  early and since the  weather was  so nice I went out and  worked on a  pile of firewood in my yard.  Some of the smaller pieces  that are good for stacking i tossed in the grill and  it fired right up and I smoked some chicken. It turned out amazing

I was told this fact by the Sisters of Saint Joseph while I was growing up in Catholic School. As were many other kids. Itas meant as a testament to God above science. As the story goes, scientists and aerodynamic experts got together and did the math and realized that with its mass and wingspan a bumblebee isn't capable of generating the lift needed to get airborne. Put more simply: a bumblebee cannot fly. Itas too fat and its wings are too short.

I waited patiantly for my income tax return and finally received it. And no i haven't went rogue with impulse purchases. I just did  the noble thing to do and take care of home, made a couple of investments and put the rest in my bank account.
Nostalgia has me by the throat today. Iam not sure why. In an effort to assuage it, I am sifting through old photos and there are some great ones from a holiday a few years ago. I had gone on a family holiday with my parents and two siblings to Munnar in the tea country of Kerala. We drove from Kottayam to Munnar and stayed for a weekend. That trip too was steeped in nostalgia as my father had grown up there.

When the three of us were little kids, our favorite bedtime stories were the 'Munar Talesa narrated with infectious enthusiasm by my father. We were never satisfied with one and would try to wheedle more by pleading hard. His yarns portrayed what seemed to be an idyllic country life to the three of us who lived in a flat in Bombay in those days. There were tales of runaway cows, gardening attempts, going to school in the cold winter and throwing up on long bus journeys down from the hills. Munnar always seemed like a little piece of heaven to me. Around the time my father went away to college, my grandfather relocated to our hometown of Kottayam following his retirement. My father didnt return for more than thirty years in fear of tainting his cherished memories. He finally gave in when the rest of his siblings planned a trip to see if their old house, school and other favorite places were still there.
Munnar still seems a lovely town to me if you stay away from the crowded and badly constructed main areas. But my father insists that it was much better sixty years ago when the British company Messrs Finlay Muir & Co ran the town. The town had grown due to the tea estates owned by Finlay Muir in the name of Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. From electricity generation to hospitals, everything was set up and managed by the company but he remembers it to be an extremely well-run town. Even the roads were washed down everyday, he says. The company also ran the school where my granddad was the Headmaster and that my father attended. He recalls the Munnar Supply Association (MSA) being a shop for the British with many imported things that seemed exotic to him like cheese and preserves. We went in to take a look on that trip but there was nothing remotely exotic in there.
Last year my parents came along on a location visit to Munnar to add properties for seek&hide. We stayed at one of our favourite homestays in Munnar, Casa del Fauno and were lucky that we caught both the glorious sunset and sunrise over a steep valley. My father looked so content and happy to be back in Munnar. The next day we visited another of our hotels in Munnar, Windermere Estate. The manager mentioned that the great grandson of James Finlay had stayed with them a while ago. So we were not the only people who were making nostalgic trips to Munnar :) If you look at these pictures, it will be clear why I am a wee bit sentimental about the place too.
when i married my husband,it is the happiest moment in my life.

Itas true that these two feelings are mutually exclusive, you just canat feel one way while feeling the other. Thatas a big reason to lean towards being happier more of the time.

My wish is to take my parents at least once there and here it has fulfilled by booking the air tickets. So by next month this time we will be enjoying our vacation in Dhubai.
Everyone are very eager to have fun.
I would have to say , I was a pretty well rounded at sports as a child, but only solitary sports. I was one of the last picked for a team for most of my childhood. Amazingly , I was okay with that. I loved to ride my bike and rode it to and from work in junior high. I would ride with my friends all summer long around town. This was our freedom, these were our wheels to get to where we wanted to go. I swam every summer at the local pool, even the swim team. But never at high school level with the girls at school. I guess you could say, fear held me back somewhat. I powerwalked into my 20as, joined a gym for awhile. Started yoga in my 30as and them started having babies. Gained too much weight, 11 years later still carring it around. For awhile I been talking to myself , saying you needs this , your body need to move.But, with 4 kids I have let everyone else's needs come before my own. I also started with a whole new kind of fear, that something could happen to me and where would my children be. Crazy how we sometimes let our negative self cheat us out of life sometimes. But I can say with much joy now it is my children , now that they are older are bringing the old comfortable me back. We got kayaks this summer and have had a absolute awesome time with them. They are the best, what a feeling of peace floating along and paddling on Flathead Lake , Montana. I stared yoga again and Iam walking more. Although I started walking because of my overweight Lab Slick. In the end we both needed that exercise.Iam finding my peace again, that peace that each of us get from being active and in our breath. Life is so short to live with self doubt and fear, so Iam going to try and wear it out! To be a champion for my kids and keep them active and be active for them!!!! How I found my new found love for sports again|MY AWESOME KIDS!!!!!!
after that i had my ooty trip to enjoy my life with friend there was an shooting point i meat my favorite hero and heroine that feel me an heart less moment i enjoyed a lot with them taking selfieeeeee and had some snacks with them that felt me an happy moment i was really happy to see them really in my life
Whatever your spiritual beliefs a or non-beliefs a may be, studies show that connecting to a high power is correlated with happiness. Just stepping back to realize that we are part of an enormous universe can put some perspective on your annoyance with the those-are-definitely-not-mine-and-they-are-abso-fricking-nan-repulsive socks under the coffee table. Before bed, spend just a few minutes contemplating something larger than yourself. Take a walk in nature. Write in a journal. Create a sacred space in your home. (Or if spirituality is really not your thing, create a home spa: light some candles, soak in a hot bath, delve into a good booka| are you feeling better yet?)
Itas true that these two feelings are mutually exclusive, you just canat feel one way while feeling the other. Thatas a big reason to lean towards being happier more of the time.

Today is Wed and I stepped in office with a big smile on my face. Let me tell you all what happened last night. At around 7:30 pm, I brought some grocery for dinner and I did change of 100 Dollar note . Usually I donat carry that much cash with me, . And while returning from shop somehow I dropped my wallet somewhere on the road. After returning to home I searched like hell all my rooms and didnt find my wallet, ran back to shop, searched roads, my apartmentas staircase but still didnt find. Human nature : Started praying to Allah, kept murmuring aPlease Allah, Please Allaha. Let me tell you I was least bothered about money that I had inside it, I was worried for all the Govt. issued card, credit and debit cards)a|. Yeah Yeah.. go on and call me stupid, even I realized this last night. The place where I stay is Fremont which is bit interior and lot of constructions are going on. This made me think that if any worker will find how he will call me. So thinking this after 1 hour, I quit searching and consoled myself that itas gone, move on. I was sad about the Govt card and trust me, I became more sad. It was pathetic. Just after few minutes, I got an unknown call. Somewhere deep down my heart, I knew this was the call I was waiting for. I was happy, the man at other end asked me to come near his house which was around 100 meters from my place. After disconnecting the call, I rana|. (Run, Forrest, Run ! was on my mind). And finally I got my wallet back with all my cards and money inside. My eyes were wet and I thanked that uncle so much. But to my surprise, he replied, aIt wasn't me, who found ita and pointed his finger towards an African American man standing besides him. He was worker and seeing him I simply jumped on him to hug him and he was very shy. I said ton of Thanks to him but I felt Thanks was very very small word at that time, the amount of money and hard work he saved for me. I was so happy I gave him 100 Dollar from my wallet and further said Please let me know if you need any kind of help, but he was very shy he refused to take money May Allah Bless him

Truer words were never spoken, and Lincoln nailed it on this quote on happiness. Itas just a matter of making up your mind to be happy, and then from there never look back. Life is like a buffet and there are all sorts of things you can focus on. Some will make you feel good and others will make you feel bad, but the choice is yours as to which ones you want to give your attention to, and where you set your mood. Realizing that you hold the key to your own happiness, and that's itas just a decision away can be a real breakthrough.

Your body gets an intervention when you fast. Your mind and relationships could use one too. Unplug yourself from the matrix.
If you havent caught on already, human beings are highly addictive creatures.We love our coffee, sugar, and internet. And these things are all great. But our lives can be far more enhanced by using these tools in wisdom.
The purpose of the internet fast is to reconnect to yourself and your loved ones. So, you probably shouldn't do it the same day you do your food fast. Because eating is one of the strongest ways to form bonds.
Youall be blown away by how much more connected you feel to your loved ones when you can give them your undivided attention. It may even feel

In his book, The Untethered Soul, Michael Singer argues that your energy should come from withinaaafrom your whyaaanot from external stimulants. The scientific backing is substantial and unsurprising: intrinsic motivation destroys extrinsic motivation every day of the week.
Motivation asideaaahealthy eating, sleeping, and intensive exercise produce higher quantities and quality of energy than caffeine ever could. A holistic approach to life is essential. Garbage in, garbage out.
Give up the caffeine and see what happens. To avoid withdrawal headachesaaawhich are mostly placeboaaareplace your caffeine with something else (another placebo). After a few days without caffeine, you'll develop confidence in your ability to function without it.
have I done any good in the world today? Have I helped anyone in need? Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad? If not, I have failed indeed. Has anyone's burden been lighter today, because I was willing to share

Each and everyone of us has a story to tell and share to others, life stories that may serve as an inspiration to other people. Every individual may have a life experience or a moment in his or her life that somehow greatly affects his or her whole life. We often share our own triumphs and travails, our victories and defeats, our happiness and despair that bring alterations to the present life situations. My story began as an ordinary boy in the state of Ferndale, Michigan. I am the youngest of five siblings, a son of Sazelia and Marvin Johnson.

My mother was a university woman who tries to acquire a bachelor's degree in Business at the University of Michigan. My father was a Mechanical Engineer who is deeply fascinated with cars. My parents are intellectual and social creatures who passed down the essential values of hard work, education and religion to their children. They make sure that we are not deprived of the essential things that we need in our education. They also impart important attitudes and ethical standards needed in conforming well to our social environment. My siblings and I grew up in happy and complete family that upholds education as the main key to success.
Look at it this way.  It's a happy daya a that honest anticipation, that hopeful expectancy spoken by my child one early morning so many month ago can be an eye opening revelation for you too.  Look for those moments. Listen for them. Wait for them. Be grateful for them.
My son was not well and suffered from ough wheeze by past a month and got realeased yesterday .
Although the amount of warfare and deaths by human hands are reducing globally, you will not get that message watching televised news or reading the newspaper.
On the contrary, these media outlets have an agenda. Their goal is to appeal to your fears by inflating extreme casesaaamaking them seem normal and commonplace. If they didnt do so, their viewership would plummet. Which is why Peter Diamandis, one of the worldas experts on entrepreneurship and the future of innovation has said, I've stopped watching TV news. They couldnat pay me enough money.a

One Month ago, one morning just beyond daybreak, I was snug in my bed, blankets tucked under my chin, sleeping the sound, deep, dreamless, sleep that comes upon a mother of two toddlers. When, suddenly, my left eyelid was peeled back from my eyeball. At last a happy day!a 
I rewatched a movie that I didn't like much the first time and was surprised to find it far more enjoyable.

We all school friend met in the alumni get together and had nice time sharing our memories.
i made porota last night
Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.


During the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overAjoyed to see and meet one another.

The following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.
The temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This aQueen of the Hill Stationsa is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.

We went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle's car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Samas Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.

The shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk sarisa, spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.

We also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.

If you let go of all your grudges, you'll gain a clear conscience and enough energy to enjoy the good things in life.The happiest people donat have the best of everything; they just make the best of everything they have.a You will have a deeper sense of contentment if you count your blessings instead of yearning for what you donat have

When I am getting ready to go to my office, My parents send off with cute smile and say, have a nice day and take care
I had sex with my girlfriend after movie. .we had reply nice time together and she was praising me foe my stamina this thing made me happy. 
I had the most unforgettable experience in my life . It is an experience about helping a blind man to cross the street. I still remember that day vividly. That night I had studied at school library; it was around 10 o'clock, and I prepared to go back home. As I passed through the school gate, I said goodbye to my friends. Suddenly I saw a strange thing in front of me. There was a male standing beside the cross-walk; the traffic light was green, he could walk forward, but he didnt. He was just standing there and made no actions. I was confused at this sight. Out of curiosity, I decided to walk over to him and to see what was happening. I felt perplexed until I walked next to him. Standing beside him, I could see he was wearing sunglasses and holding a white stick; then I knew this man was blind. In this cold winter day, pedestrians all wore heavy coats, including him and me. His was gray and mine was black. I also noticed that there was a sign around his neck. The sign said aI am virtually deaf and blind; please help me cross the street. Tap me on the shoulder.a I knew I must help him. So I tapped him on the shoulder, and then he put his left hand on my right shoulder and I led him across the street. All the process was quiet; the only thing I could hear was the sounds of our steps. It was a chilly night too, but I knew he would feel warm at this moment. When we got across the street, he bowed in thanks, and started walking up the block, to the next corner, then the next. While he walked past me, I couldnat help but start to weep. I wanted to walk him home. It was not a very busy street, almost deserted. He could have been there, on that corner, for 10 minutes. Maybe he is still at another corner, now, waiting. How does he get home? How does he know where his home is? Thinking of this, I cried more loudly. I canat image being deaf and blind. You would be so helpless and dependent on other people. Can you imagine going home like that every day: walking a block, then waiting for someone to help you get across the street, then walking another block, and waiting, relying on the kindness of strangers? After this incident, I realized how blessed I am. I should cherish every day and do my best to help the people who need help in my life.


There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesn't come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy. They maintain a positive outlook on life and remain at peace with themselves.
Happy people understand that itas better to forgive and forget than to let their negative feelings crowd out their positive feelings. Holding a grudge has a lot of detrimental effects on your wellbeing, including increased depression, anxiety, and stress. Why let anyone who has wronged you have power over you? If you let go of all your grudges, you'll gain a clear conscience and enough energy to enjoy the good things in life.

The proposal was insanely ambitiousareal people, alone or in groups, dance to the song, essentially creating an entire dayas worth of music videosaand therefore riddled with creative challenges, which is like manna to Pharrell: aThe best work comes from people who are motivated by crisisawhen something stops the original idea, they respond by coming up with something even better. Existence is all mathematics,a he says. There's an equation for success in every obstacle.a
A smile never cost anybody anything and a day seems to go better when you are surrounded by colleagues that smile and are willingly to help you anytime or just to hug you when you are not feeling ok.If all the people around us would be open minded we would all have something to gain. We all feel very motivated do our job the best way we can when we have a very good training program. Thereby you can receive better feedback  you can work more focused and you can improve your skills when you know you'll be rewarded.
 I felt the most happy was probably accepting my ex's Boss. I've never been that excited and overjoyed about something. Didn't end up working out, but, y'know.

Once you accept the fact that life is not fair, you'll be more at peace with yourself. Instead of obsessing over how unfair life is, just focus on what you can control and change it for the better.
With today's politicians, bankers, lawyers and public service executives, it is hardly surprising that old farts like me and my wife (that's a novelty today) resort to remembering old times to grasp at happy memories and feel better

Watching the sun rise, getting a raise, putting a smile on someone's face these are all examples of when a person may feel a happy. They are all diverse, just like the individualas in the world. Happiness is acquired through countless stimuli, whether they are material or emotional. One can not give a general definition for happiness, due to the fact that each person has their own perception of what happiness is. Happiness lies in the eye of the beholder, and as the beholder I see happiness as:Thus through this essay I will describe what happiness means to me, by discussing the above mentioned. I have found that through completing my happy Moments Journal,a that my family is a huge element of my happiness. Over half of the entries in my journal involved some interaction or thought of my family. A couple of examples include having Sunday lunch with my family. Everyone basically, comes together after church and we sit down and eat lunch together and then spend the rest of the day talking and just enjoying each others company. Also, going out with my sister and cousin on the weekends is always brings happiness into my life.

Making a 24-hour interactive video has always been one of WAFLA's dream projects. Their goal was to create an endless video that loops a series of shots in an infinite sequence. The entire video has been made with dancers whose art is a symbol for what the video is all about: happiness. Pharrell appears over the duration as though heas the metronome for the project, while a website was also designed to host the video featuring an encyclopedia of world dances and a facility that allows users to film their own contribution to the project.
I took my wife to a new local restaurant, and afterward she told me she liked it! This is usually not the case. Her tastes seem to be 180 degrees the opposite of mine.

Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority. If you think someone else is better than you, you end up feeling bad about yourself. Youall be happier if you focus on your own progress and praise others on theirs.
For the first time I have drive our car alone today upto 1km alone without others guidance
I like traveling. Iam very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I donat like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when Iam go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island.

The Basilica of Bom Jesus is the most august and famous of all the churches in Old Goa. It contains the relics of St.Framcis Xavier, Patron saint of Goa, Apostle of the Indies. The construction of the church began on the 24th November 1594 AD. It is built of black laterite stone. The relics of St Francis Xavier were kept in this chapel from 1623-55 AD. The Blessed Sacrament was earlier kept on the main altar under the statue of St Ignatius and now is preserved in a gold tabernacle. The body of St. Francis Xavier was brought here from the College of St Paul after his canonization in 1624 AD. It was shifted to its present location in 1655 AD. The crystal urn was made in the Casa Brandizzi at Rome and was brought to Goa on January 30th 1955. The old wooden coffin with its three keys is now kept in the museum at the Professed House of the Jesuits
From there we headed towards Aguada Fort but it was very dark that we could not able to see the site.

Human life is the collection of some important events. Of those events, some events are forgotten but some other events are so important and heart touching that can not be forgotten and remain fresh in the mind. My first day school is one of those events which will remain ever fresh in my heart. I was then 6 years old. One day my mother told me that I was going to start my school the next day. I was very excited. I couldnat think of anything else. I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, and the students of the school. I couldnat even sleep at night. The next morning my mother woke me up early in the morning. I had a bath and put on my best clothes. Having breakfast we started walking towards the school. After half an hour we reached the school.  I saw many students on the school campus. Some were playing and some were talking to each other. But I did not know any one. So, I got little nervous. My mother took me to the headmaster's room. He asked me some questions. As I could answer them all, he became pleased. He called in a teacher and send me to my class with her. I was admitted to class one. The class teacher and the student receive me heartily. Though I was little nervous, soon I became easy. I will remember the day as long as I live.
Very often people donat remember their day-by-day routine, but if something unusual or extra
ordinary happens. It can be memorable and remarkablefor the rest of their lives.
For me, such remarkable event was the light show of dancing fountains. I saw this show for the
first time when I was 10 years old. Since that time I saw shows like that several times, but the
feelings of the very first time are still in my haert and they are unforgettable.
The show had to start during sunset, and since it was arranged on the bank of the rive on a hot
summer day everything around bacame pink. Trees, river, air, people around -everything was
painted with a tender pink colour. That day was extremely hot but in the evening the air turned to
be fresh and clean. The blowing breeze was very pleasant. The show was delayed. At first we
were nervous about that, but now I understand that it was planned ahead and we were really
lucky to see the sunset. Very soon it became darker and at last the show started.
The show was accompanied by modern music and the fountains really danced and people
danced too. Everybody was so excited!
I was really very happy that I havent took the advantage of his mistake. Now, why Iaam happy because, I knew that Iam honest but sometime when you realise your honest self, itas a pleasure for you, itas a happiness for your soul and this happiness everyone should have in their life at least once, in whatever way it comes.

Having the feeling of losing a loved one is something that everyone eventually experiences. Losing my grandpa in a car accident is by far the most devastating thing I had to learn to cope with. My grandpa and I were really close. We did many things together until the day somebody decided to have a drink while driving behind the wheel. Not only did the drunk driver pay dearly for his senseless act. He also took my grandfather's life when he collided into the side of his car.
             Though my grandfather's death was five years ago, I still remember him. An image of him is still locked in my mind, but my memories of him are faint. After breakfast on Saturdays, we would play in the park and feed the ducks. I would hold my grandpaas hand and I remember how his hands felt very much like paper, yet very callused from long years of hard work. When it rained out, he baked me fudge brownies and cookies. My grandpa was always there when I needed a wound to be tended to or when I was sick and not feeling well. I miss my grandpa dearly with all my heart, and I wish I could tell him now how much I miss everything we used to do together.

This aone happy momenta is described in more detail by Dryden and has the ability to keep out Time and Death, when they would seize us [the lovers]a which again illustrates the mystical powers of love (line 14). Personally, this idea seems very related to John Keatsa aOde on a Grecian Urn,a specifically his images of a man lusting after a woman: aShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, / For ever wilt thou love, and she be faira (Keats)! In Keatsa poem, the idea that love is everlasting and transcends time is present since he describes an image of a man and woman forever etched on a Grecian urn. In Drydenas love poem, he too writes about how this aone happy momenta has the ability to disregard time a the lovers are truly living in the moment.

Resilient people tend to have what psychologists call an internal locus of controla. They believe the actions they take will affect the outcome of an event. Another characteristic of resilience is the understanding that life is full of challenges. While business leaders cannot avoid many of these problems, they can remain open, flexible and willing to adapt to change.

There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesnt come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within.

They will hate you if you are beautiful. They will hate you if you are successful. They will hate you if you are right. They will hate you if you are popular. They will hate you when you get attention. They will hate you when people in their life like you. They will hate you if you worship a different version of their God. They will hate you if you are spiritual. They will hate you if you have courage. They will hate you if you have an opinion. They will hate you when people support you. They will hate you when they see you happy. Heck, they will hate you while they post prayers and religious quotes on Pinterest and Facebook. They just hate. However, remember this: They hate you because you represent something they feel they donat have. It really isn't about you. It is about the hatred they have for themselves. So smile today because there is something you are doing right that has a lot of people thinking about you.

The song aHappya is just a couple seconds short of 4 minutes long. The whole video consists of a series different sections,a each of which lasts exactly 4 minutes, over which the song is played. So there are 360 sections total. Most of the sections consist of someone dancing towards a camera that is slowly backing away from them. There are of course variations in number of people and movement of camera (and there are several sections that are all about motor vehicles).

Happiness, a main goal of modern life, undeniable becomes the biggest concern of the world. An increasing number of people pay more attention on that ones job or social life which has more influences on our happiness. Different people have view this issue in different angle. Nevertheless, I hold the idea that both my job and social life are important to my happiness and both of them serve indispensable functions.

To begin with, a secure job meets my fundamental demands. With a job, I can receive payment, which supports my personal expenses such as paying for a meal, purchasing a fashion dress, renew my apartment and so forth. All these are the security to ensure my independent life and the source of freedom and happiness. Without a job, it is impossible for me to live a happy life. In this case, indeed, my job enjoys a vital impact on my happiness.

Furthermore, social life, also a necessary part of modern life, has a profound effect on everyone. As far as Iam concerned, social life contains that keeping an inmate relationship with friends, family and co-workers. It would be hard to imagine if one have a terrible social life or even have no social life, how out-dated he or she will be and how tedious his or her life will be. Every year, I will spend my holidays traveling with my friends and family during which we can take beautiful photos and share private life stories with each other. These unforgettable memories are my lifelong measures and bring me endless happiness.

To sum up, my job and my social life serve as different benefits. And they are equally important and both beneficial to my happiness. My job meets the needs and expenses of my daily life, providing sufficient physical fundaments which are the security of a happy life. In addition, my social life allows me to keep a harmony relationship with friends and family and brings a source of happiness. In turn, both my job.
Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority. If you think someone else is better than you, you end up feeling bad about yourself. Youall be happier if you focus on your own progress and praise others on theirs.

Nowadays, people live in a busier world stuffed with endless routines from the work than that in the past. Besides the decent job that one might have, enjoying the wonderful and trustful social life are something worth pursuing as well. However, it seems that everyone in the workplace just wants to get his/her jobs done, and it is apparently that one always shares less interaction with people than that in the social life. Thereby, I disagree with the description above. To reinforce my statement, here are the reasons behind it.

First of all, for instance of mine, a regular job doesn't occupy much of my personal time. There are over half of the day allowing me to live in the world out of the daily annoyed work. Therefore, I feel enjoyable to manage my social life. I get used to writing my personal blog, answering the questions that someone else leaves. I interact with huge variety of people, discussing with the latest trends in technology or society. Moreover, I meet different friends with wide diversity of characteristics in some atmospheric cafes nearby where I live. Those kinds of feelings of connecting with people truthfully rather than in the relationship of employees and employers always help me open my mind spontaneously to others. 

Secondly, managing such a great social life grants me sense of achievement and happiness. Some may liken how successful the one could be in work to how much happiness can enjoy in life, but I am not on that side. A wonderful social life consists of tons of friends is something that can last longer, because there is always some day that we will leave our job. Without devoting much of our time then, we may acquire sense of loneliness if we donat have a robust or trustworthy relationships with others. Friends made in the job is highly prone to lose connections when you and friends of yours no longer work together or share the same goal. Besides, the friendships built off work have those sort of conflicts less. 
Junk food makes you sluggish, and itas difficult to be happy when youare in that kind of state. Everything you eat directly affects your body's ability to produce hormones, which will dictate your moods, energy, and mental focus. Be sure to eat foods that will keep your mind and body in good shape.

He replied thank you so much and crying and holding my hand. I was shocked and I said donat worry anymore. I will manage your credits and I will pay the hospital bills, he said you're so great!!! Thank you and he smiled, I too smiled and happy. Thank you.

Many people take this week off from work and school to spend time with their families. The holidays are a good time to strengthen our connections and renew relationships. So turn off the cell phones, computers and televisions and take time to focus on your family.
  Research shows that families who spend time together are strong families. They communicate better and share a sense of belonging. Here are a few ideas you can try to spend time with your family.
     * Family game night. Spend at least one night during the holidays with the TV off and the family huddled together to play a favorite game. You may play cards, bingo or any other family favorite. Consider continuing this practice throughout the year and designate at least one night per week as family game night.
     * Go for a walk. After eating rich holiday foods, taking a walk provides not only time together but a great way to get some exercise.
     * Movie night. Rent a movie or watch a TV holiday special, pop some popcorn, and kick back for some family fun. Like game night, this may be something you'd like to continue throughout the year as a way to spend time together.
     * Play outdoors together. You can ride bikes, play ball, or go for a hike. Itall give the entire family some fresh air, exercise and great fun.
     * Go shopping. Hang out together while shopping at the after Christmas sales.
      * Cook together. Parents and kids can do the holiday baking and food preparation together. Even the youngest children can wash vegetables, set the table, or ice cookies.
     * Spend some one-on-one time with each child if you have more than one. Spending time alone provides time to bond with the child and helps him gain a sense of belonging and feeling of importance. It also provides an opportunity for the two of you to get to know each other better.
     * Since grandparents and older family members usually visit during the holidays, take time to share family customs and tell stories about past generations. Families build strength when they share family customs and traditions give family members a sense of belonging, and they strengthen values and beliefs. 
     One of the greatest gifts of the holiday season is the gift of time with family. Spend time together to strengthen relationships and to make wonderful family memories. Strong families spend time with each other - quality time in large quantities. So begin during the holidays and continue making time for each other throughout the year.

I am going through a rough patch in life today. I am at my wits end and feel like just throwing in the towel and giving up. I know this does not sound happy but the happy moment is because of this.

I have been in love with a girl for the past 10 years. She is a girl who have not been exposed to the public a much as she has been sticking to her studies and home so far. Recently she started working and i found she started to minkle more with people around and chatting with new friends especially boys. That hurted me badly. Now you must be thinking how does this makes me happy. I have been hearing from childhood that we only love or go close to god when we realize that anything or anyone in this world cannot give us true unconditional love and happiness thus leading us to detachment. The moment i realized that every relation which is worldly is with expectations and the love i felt from him during that loneliness made me extremely happy.

Okay, so a couple of months ago I graduated from university - it was a really happy time for me, and although my family and I had already celebrated finishing my degree successfully, the official graduation day ceremony was really quite special, and a very happy day, for me and my friends. It was one of the last times that all of us were together because shortly after that two of our group left to go abroad and they'll be there for about two years before they come back home.

So, the graduation ceremony was in the main auditorium of the university and everyone was there, all the students, faculty members and of course family and other invited guests. There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.

There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.

Later on, when the family members had left we went out to a bar and had a few beers together just me and my friends. Looking back on it now, it was one of the happiest days of my life I think a we all felt like we had really achieved something graduating and that particular day was really good for all of us. I hope that maybe in a couple of years we can arrange a sort of reunion a so that we can all get together again and catch up with each other.

Three weeks ago, my wife's long coming professional promotion to a senior managerial position in her firm finally became effective to a senior managerial position in her firm. She is settling into the role rather comfortably, and indeed so well deserved a milestone. Her competent, efficient, productive, coveted, fore & far sighted leadership assets are well known around the company. She is quite happy about these new responsibilities & I am at once profoundly proud of her for this achievement as well as for the wonderful, unparalleled gifted lives that she has made possible for us as a family. She is a deeply loving, deeply caring, selfless, brilliant, a force of nature and very beautiful wonder woman. I am at a loss for thought, feelings & words as to where on earth I would be without her magical angelic existence in our lives. She rocks my world. Hence, I uncorked the champagnes & celebrate this terrific pick with her. This was ever so, for me, one of the happiest, most awesome moments. What can I say beyond that, you ask? Plenty. But, I will do you a favor and halt right here. No further comments.   
I was worried one of my pets (I have lots of pets) had stomach cancer, after what one of my vets said during her last visit. He said that she may need a biopsy of her stomach. However, he soon learned that she does not have stomach cancer with no surgery necessary. She has feline IBD (irritable bowel), which is helped by dietary change and probiotics and steroids.
A small moment of happiness was when my son gave me a hug and told me I was his best friend.
I finished my last day of fieldwork for my clinicals the other day. It was my last day before graduation.

The pursuit of happiness is so crucial that we try a lot of motivational strategies to make our employees productive. Happy employees tend to work efficiently and effectively since they emit positive energy, it is for this reason why they have to have proper compensation in order for them to enjoy and love their respective job.

Yet, for those of us who have lived abroad, this is simply the way it is.

The first time I experienced what experts call reverse Culture Shocka was after returning home from a Year Abroad Program in Galway, Ireland. My home town, which before had given me a sense of comfort and belonging, upon returning seemed stifling and bereft of warmth. I moved about my days feeling that something was missing but I had no idea what it could be. I eventually came face to face with the starling reality that my home would never, ever again feel the same as it had before. I had sealed my fate the moment I had boarded that plane the year before.

I donat think there is really any way to describe this feeling to those who havent experienced it themselves.  Itas a little like free-falling.  It feels as if we are floating aimlessly on restless waters.  We feel distinctly ungrounded
the day i adopted a kitten that was a stray
My father, who has been disgnosed with fibromyalgia, was finally approved for a medicine that has the power to take away 90% of his pain, giving him a new start on life. 
I WENT TO TEMPLE
I was gifted a bbq grill by my friend
The Christmas gathering took place on December 25 in 2016. All of my relatives gathered in my grandpa's place one or two days before the event. I have two paternal uncles and three aunts. They arrived with their kids. On the other side, we were six in number. So, it was almost a medium-scale crowd there. Everyone one greeted each other and shared their feelings. Additionally, my grandparents were extremely happy with this crowd of people. Actually, they are to live almost alone round the year and this is the time when they have chances to spend some quality moments. My grandpa was a retired professor of Physics while my grandma took care of the house. My parents or uncles were unable to meet them in regular days for their hefty schedules. The gathering was arranged each year to keep the bondage alive among all. So, in this time of the year, we made the gathering at my grandpa's place.

I booked a disneyworld vacation.
My daughters face when I arrived at her door with the 10 size 24 mths onesies that she wasn't able to get out of the house to purchase.
My best friend og 16 years finally texted me after giving me the cold shoulder for the past 2 months because she did not like some advice i gave her that she asked for.
I watched spider man 2 and ate little caesar's pizza in a private theater with my partner.
Recently, I received the email notifying me that I had been selected to participate in Somos nan. I am very excited to participate in this, and only 15 have been lucky to be here, so I feel lucky for this too.
I went on a vacation with 5 other friends, it was so fun and I have a bittersweet feeling of happiness that I went but sadness that it's over.
My brother called me 3 weeks ago saying he was finally moving back home after being away from almost 7 years
i was extremely happy when I made enough money to pay my bills with out struggling.

febuary 14 Valentine's day 
My most memorable moment happened in my school days. The moment happened when I was in class 4 , while the school day annual celebration
was going on ,suddenly my name was been announced that I got the first prize in telugu eloctution ,still that time I have not even got any prize even though I participated in many cultural activities and sports events .so on hearing my name I got surprised and become proud to receive that. while receiving the prize I was been praised by my classmates ,class teacher and the principal.so thats why i consider it as a most memorable moment which was unforgettable in my life.
febuary 14 valentine's day
It made me happy to receive good news from a source that I needed to accomplish a very important challenge that will change my life.
2 Months ago, i got promotion in my office and i was selected as the employee of the month. I was too happy, because i never expected that promotion and i thought i was the inefficient employee in my office, but they selected me as the employee of the month and my superiors congratulated me personally. That made me more happy
The Kashmiri doesnat care whose flag he follows, whose anthem he sounds. As long as the Kashmiri gets to row his shikara, herd his sheep, temper his willow bats, grow his apples and light his kangri in peace, whatas an India, what is a Pakistan.

It has been an illuminating first day in Kashmir. The flight from Delhi spelt its own episodes, but thatas another, rather insignificant, story. A delay caused due to fog meant that we touched down at Srinagar Airport an hour behind schedule.

But enough of that; let the story begin.
The passage from the boarding gate to the baggage check reminds me of a Republic Day paradeawithout the celebration. Rows of stoic-looking men in full combat gear holding INSAS rifles greet me as I proceed towards the baggage counter. On the arrivals desk across the hall, a mini-police station of sorts deals with nervous-looking foreigners and Kashmiris on their way out. The customary chatter and hubbub youad find in any airport is much subdued here.
The driveras name is Shakeel Ahmed. A man of average height, with an oval-shaped head, a self-conscious smile and the customary reserve youad find in town folk whenever they encounter city dwellers like myself.

That reserve dissolves quickly as I start asking him about the Kashmiri way of life.

well sir, the people here, they like to work,a he says, smoothly overtaking a truck carrying logs. aWhether itas growing saffron, or almonds, weaving cloth, or going to school, we like to stay occupied. Thatas why I donat like winter so much. Too little time to get out and about.a

As we cross Lal Chowk, I am struck by the inconspicuousness of roadside beggars anywhere.

aOh, you wonat find any beggars in Kashmir, sir,a Shakeel says, aKashmiris are a proud people. We donat like opening our palms, except in prayer.a

The Kashmiri livelihood, I learn, comes from growing things and showing things. The village folk depend on saffron, almonds, apples, wood and weaving for their livelihood. City dwellers are invested in various services for the visiting tourist.

aThereas plenty of money in Kashmir,a Shakeel remarks, abut you wonat see it out in the open. We are not ostentatious by nature.a

An offhand barb at Delhi brashness, I suspect, but let it pass.
We pass through a crowded marketplace. Glittering streamers and flags of Pakistan hang from the ropeways overhead. I ask him about the flags.

aOh, they arenat Pakistani flags, sir,a he replies with a short laugh. aThese are for Bada Din. Look, that banner over there says aId Milaapa.a

Donat I feel foolish.

actually, this district, Pulwama, it has 95 per cent Muslims. Bada Din is celebrated with a lot of pomp and circumstance. That road forking right leads to Pulwama town. Itas renowned for its shopian apples and, well, other things,a Shakeel says with a quiet smile.

The other things, it turns out, are afeem (opium) and hashish (marijuana).

aSaara do number ka kaam wahaan par hota hai, sir,a remarks Shakeel with a wink.

I return the wink as a road milestone closes. aPahalgam: 98 kilometres,a the sign reads.
Weave pulled over beside a large shop with a sign that reads aKesar Valley'. Shakeel seems to have taken a personal affront to the fact that Iave never had kahwah in my life, and decides the experience can wait no longer.
Two bearded men nurse the counter, sitting cross-legged on low stools. The long table in front of them displays almonds, kernels, tiny containers of saffron, cans of almond oil, homemade hand cream and a host of other items. One of them rises to greet me.

aSalaam ailakum, welcome to Kesar Valley.a

Tall, bearded, unsmiling, with intense, brooding eyes, Nisaar Ahmad could be the worst fear of any ignoramus who pays heed to manufactured media. Shakeel exchanges a quiet word with the other man, who then disappears behind a curtain.

Nisaar comes straight to business. Directing my attention to a stack of photo frames, he begins, aOur roots lie in saffron farming. My grandfather grew saffron, his son grew saffron after him, and nowa|,a he gestures to himself.

His companion returns with a bag of almonds.

aTry them. No, in fact, crush them on the counter here,a Nisaar commands, there, see the way the oil oozes out? You won't find almonds like these anywhere outside Kashmir.a


White walls and uncomfortable chairs arenat the greatest amplifier for creativity. If you're not getting the greatest results from your brainstorms, surely the monotone work environment has its role. Maybe a colorful room, with all kind of inspirational images on walls, a comfy chair and a hilarious rug will kick off that wild imagination of yours.
When you've finished a really good book and you just put it down on your lap and stare into space for a couple minutes because you need to collect yourself and return to reality.
Surprises, Good surprises make me happy
Being awake when everyone else is asleep.
when 2 months back my marriage had  that moment was so afraid and excited and I was  so happy at once I  felt that some new had entered into my life
My neighbor brought over some home made lasagna for dinner. This was great because not only does she make great lasagna, I had a hectic day at work and had no idea what I would make for supper. Also, the company for supper was a pleasant surprise and a nice distraction after a bad day. The food was good and the company was great.
Letas say you choose a job just for paying your rent and you're waiting for a dream job opportunity. But, whatever you're doing you want to be appreciated for your work. And how can we judge a fish by its climbing skills? We canat.
When i got home from work yesterday, my 2 year old son came running to hug me shouting "DADDY'S HOME".

I was walking with my dog, Remy, and he stopped at a telephone pole..he peed and then he started kicking at the ground. All four of his legs were furiously scratching the ground and grass/dirt was flying up behind him in a spray of about 5 feet. It was so funny and it made me so happy. I laughed and laughed. I wish I had it on video, but I was laughing to hard to get my phone out before it ended.
I participate in surveys on a wide variety of platforms. One in particular, included a lottery bonus possibility. I found out that I won! The extra money was greatly needed and appreciated and as someone who never wins anything, was quite the pleasant surprise.
I was able to solve a rubik's cube in record time. 
I went to a charity nan.
Dragonball Super had a story arc featuring the return of my favorite character.
Seeing a gal who works for me get a car after she been saving for several months. She was able to get a good price on the car she wanted and had finally saved up.

After marriage, there is a ritual where the bride goes with bridegroom to his home. This is called aBidaia meaning abeading farewell to bride all the relatives were grouped together for the ceremony. It is an emotional moment. I also remembered about my daughters abeading farewell ceremonya It was a very happy moment. 
After my crush agreed to go on a date with me.

Last week i saw BAHUBALI film in cinipriya theatre with my friends.The film is very good,graphics and artist acting very excellent.Especially kattappa roll character very nice.Interval time we ate some snacks and pizza.We spend in theatre 3 hours.Then we went hotel ate briyani and we back our home.
It means when we get the desired one in our life, that is 
the most happiest moment. the happiest moment is change to 
person to person and time to time, as far as regarding my 
moment is concerned my first son ADHWIK got admission in BE. I felt that he 
would not get better marks in that because, from 12th  he
studied in TAMIL medium but BE was in HINDI medium. But he 
didn't get nervous, studied harder ,struggled more and 
practice more at the end he got highest marks in that. so it 
is the most happiest moment in my life according to me because of him.

After 15 years our school friends organized the get together and 45 members get together- ed and spent lot  of time. It's an unforgettable event in my life after a long back
It was a rainy season, heavy rain. Me and my friends out in that place a pregnant lady, screaming and crying on the way. There is a heavy rain no people stands on the road. And also its a mid night time 1 clock. Me and my friends take that lady to our room. We are all engineering students. I made a call to my wife anju and tell about this. Anju asked me to on the video call and saw that lady in video. She said not to worry to that lady and also to cooperate with us. Anju asked me take a hot water and cloth to treat that pregnant lady. Then she asked the pregnant lady to push push slowly breath and push. And also my wife asked me not to scare. Then we helped that lady for her delivery. Then a cute boy baby born for that poor lady. We saved that lady and the child. It was an happiest moment and also my wife praised me for helping that lady. The engineer students worked as a doctor. So from this i  understood not only studies make a man best in world. Only if we have effort and confident we can learn everything in the world by our own effort. 
Not anybody can brag about having a mentor at their job. A mentor is not only a teacher, it is the person that inspires you, the person from whom you want 'steal' the knowledgeas of the job or you want to enjoy his asuccess secretsa.

I enjoy seeing neatness and orderliness and every time I straighten up the garden it makes me feel really happy.
Whatever your spiritual beliefs a or non-beliefs a may be, studies show that connecting to a high power is correlated with happiness. Just stepping back to realize that we are part of an enormous universe can put some perspective on your annoyance with the those-are-definitely-not-mine-and-they-are-abso-fricking-lutely-repulsive socks under the coffee table. Before bed, spend just a few minutes contemplating something larger than yourself. Take a walk in nature. Write in a journal. Create a sacred space in your home.

My son was evaulated by the interventional unit and deemed to be cognitively fit. 
Last weekend my little brother came over because he wanted my help with his project for astronomy. We reminisced, laughed and teased each other and acted silly. We would have gotten his project done sooner if we wouldn't have been laughing so much. It reminded me of when we were kids and I would help him with his homework and we would do the same things we did last weekend.
A few weeks ago my cat was bitten by a snake and got really sick. After some days on meds, he is doing a lot better now and I am very happy he did not die. It was scary for a while. Now I am happy he is on the mend properly and almost like his old self.

Sitting on your desk all day long could have long term negative effects on your health. And as we all know unhealthy people are not happy. A chair that makes you feel like you're in heaven, which keeps you relaxed while you work, can transform the nasty tasks in a breeze. And isnat this a great reason to be happy?

My first event that made me happy in the past 3 months would have to be when I finally got the local school district to re-new my children's IEPs.

MY BROTHER IN LAW GOT STATE 7TH RANK IN INTERMEDIAT SO I AM VERY HAPPY TO LAST WEEK
A week before I went to my native place for a cultural function. When I was drinking a cup of coffee I saw one of my old friend who came from US last week. We were discussing about our life and he took a ' Sai Baba photo' from his purse and showed me did I remember. Very long back when we were studying in school , when he came with a trouble I gave him the photo and console that till the photo is with him he will not be in trouble. He in remembrance of me kept the photo safely without torn. At that moment I was very much happy and that movement could not be expressed and could only feeled.
I finished my pre-reqs for a master's program

I graduated from university - it was a really happy time for me, and although my family and I had already celebrated finishing my degree successfully, the official graduation day ceremony was really quite special, and a very happy day, for me and my friends. It was one of the last times that all of us were together because shortly after that two of our group left to go abroad and they'll be there for about two years before they come back home.

Can we plan for Tirupati Balaji Mandir on 17th ?a An unexpected noon phone call from Hubby.

aI may, if you want to goa|." I was quick to reply, but, added one "But" to it....

"But I won't guarantee whether I would go inside the temple or nota|.if itas too much of crowd, I may give up half the way took|a I clarified.

So, a quick plan was made with two other families, Hubbyas colleagues, Basav and Silky with their families. 

Itas been long time, though I felt like visiting this - one of the richest temples in the world, it was not in my wish-list as I heard it is one of the most crowded temples too. On an average 50,000 to 100,000 devotees visit the Tirupati Balaji temple at Tirumala every day. Sandip, Nabami, Mittal, so many friends of mine shared their experience with me that itas just for 5 -10 seconds, one get a glimpse of the Idol of Lord Balaji. The pushing crowd and security personals would push you forward automatically.  

On 16th, the day was too hectic for me. Work, dizziness and the tension of facing huge crowd at the temple made me so exhausted that sleeping queen refused to come to my eyes even for a minute, though I tried to bring her in at least for 4 hours.

We started at 1:57 AM from Bangalore on 17th, while I vomited on the way twice, because of my uneasiness. I just recalled my pregnancy time that moment. We reached Tirupati town at 7:30 AM. We already had booked one hotel. This time, sleeping queen attacked me badly and took me to a deep sleep for at least one hour.

Somehow, I managed to get up from Bed at 8:30 AM, quickly took bath and tried my level best to be positive in attitude. We were out from the hotel by 9 AM.

In the first entrance of the Temple campus, we had a proper security check; every individual, the luggage, and the vehicle, all were scanned.
Beautiful view, cleanliness of the town, stunning curvy roads made us fresh and positive. There was a special instruction on speed limit while driving up the Tirumala hill, 25 kilometer of ascent is to be completed not earlier than 28 minutes. In case, any vehicle reaches there early, it will be penalized for driving fast. 
Basav shaved his hair, and during that time, rest of us just had some quick breakfast in one of the roadside stalls. I was just amazed to see the cleanliness all around. Some people were sitting in the middle of the road even, to eat food.
We covered the whole queue area in 20 mins. No electronic items are allowed, such as camera, mobile phones, but they allow wallets. Everyone has to wear traditional dresses, for man, dhoti or kurta were mandatory and for woman, Saree, Salwar suit etc. There was a strict security check just before entering the main temple area. There were drinking water tanks in every 100 mtrs distance. And free food items were offered to the people while in the queue.

On the way, we saw many waiting rooms which were locked. Other days, the devotees are released from these rooms slot by slot, to make queues. The most important entrance of the place, where the statue of Lord Balaji is kept, aadat se majbur people were pushing forward for no reason, though there were not lots many people. Basav, from his previous experience suggested us to keep ourselves extreme right so that we could see the statue without any distraction. Luckily, I managed to keep some gap in the last moment, while hubby picked son on his shoulders and the divine moment stayed with me for at least 15 seconds while I kept  my eyes on the most desired statue at sanctum sanctorum.

While coming out from that space, there is another chamber where one can write his/her wish with a coin and drop that coin there itself. When the secret wish accomplishes, the person has to come back to say aThanksa.
Prasad in the form of Ladoo is available outside the temple premise.  Two free ladoos which are very tasty, prepared with ghee and dry fruits are given per Sheegra darshan ticket. Each extra ladoo costs Rs 25. There is free food service also, but we were so tired that we could not eat it.

So, coming out from the main temple, there is another temple of Hanumanji. One can break a coconut and devote there. One thing, I noticed is that, you won't hesitate to sit on the floor anywhere inside the campus, as it was very clean.

There are many food stalls, and lines of shops, where the stuff were not so costly, be it home dA(c)cor, idols, devotional items or cloth.

Lovely experience it wasa|..Lucky was me as I did not have to give up half the way, not had to face crowd, and above all, had a longer glimpse of Lord Balaji!

The pursuit of happiness is so crucial that we try a lot of motivational strategies to make our employees productive. Happy employees tend to work efficiently and effectively since they emit positive energy, it is for this reason why they have to have proper compensation in order for them to enjoy and love their respective job. If the employee is in the state of being happy, he/she is thrice innovative. These 25 little things can really make them feel important and they'll be dedicated to their respective work.
yesterday we made "biryani" with the help of you tube, its a north indian food made of chicken, so nice to eat and we all became happy with the successful preparation
Childhood is the best time of one's life and most of the adults want to get back on the childhood days. I was given a novel as the first prize in my school in my early childhood which was a happy event for me and I still remember it very vividly.In my junior school, the authority held different competitions to motivate the students into learning and attending the school. As part of the activities, they annually organised different competitions like debates, painting, indoor sports and more other events. I took part in a competition and got the first prize by beating five other contestants. It was the first major success in my life and I remember it most as it was in my early childhood 
The sunrise was gorgeous. Very pink and clear. It felt like I should've been able to hear Morgan Freeman's voice in the background saying something inspirational. 
I'm doing good in rehab after an opoid addiction.  4 months clean. I'm going to stay clean.
I met someone. Initially I was excited because they were autistic like myself. But now I realize, I have felt falsely strong and projected. So it is bittersweet yet I am still happy to have met someone and made yet another experience. I look back and in retrospect I know things are a mistake. There are so many mistakes I knew whilst making them. I am gleefully accepting of this time in my life with profound wisdom.

I spontaneously flew a cessna plane in Anchorage Alaska. My friend was a friend of a private pilot that took us out flying to look at glaciers. When we were in a safe spot he let me pilot the plane and explained all the instruments. This has inspired me to get my pilots license.

MY COLLEGE 1ST DAY INAUGURATION FUNCTION
MY COLLEGE 1ST DAY INAUGURATION FUNCTION
Myself and my family enjoyed a hill station trip after their children's annual exams, This trip made them happy, and their joy made me happy.
Me and my friend went for a shopping and took 3 shirts for him and we returned back to home after booking a cab.The day was so fulfilled
I got a check from massSave for a rebate on my new furnace.
every moment of my life is happy becz i leave the life in present but happiest moment when achieve in life some new.
Two month before when I was travelling in train one person who was travelling adjacent to me  while getting down from train missed a bag in the train. I opened the bag and found it was his degree certificate with some more document and an interview card. I felt that he is going for an interview. Even though I got plenty of works , I stepped down in the next train station and went to the company in the card. There I saw the person searching something and went to him and told the fact and gave him the bag and advised him to be more careful. The person overwhelmed with joy and thanks me a lot and offered me the actual expense that was occured by me for him. But I refused . I felt that reciving is only not happy but helping to others also in time is also happy.
I recently was told by one of my coworkers who works in dispatch that I am his favorite driver on the team.  I am a paratransit driver, I drive a cabulance for disable people.
This guy took a job from me at work but it turned out kind of shittily for him.

Happiness is so interesting, because we all have different ideas about what it is and how to get it. Itas also no surprise that itas the Nr.1 value for Bufferas culture, if you see our slidedeck about it. So naturally we are obsessed with it.
I would love to be happier, as Iam sure most people would, so I thought it would be interesting to find some ways to become a happier person that are actually backed up by science. Here are ten of the best ones I found.
1. Exercise more a 7 minutes might be enough
You might have seen some talk recently about the scientific 7 minute workout mentioned in The New York Times. So if you thought exercise was something you didnt have time for, maybe you can fit it in after all.
Exercise has such a profound effect on our happiness and well-being that itas actually been proven to be an effective strategy for overcoming depression. In a study cited in Shawn Achoras book, The Happiness Advantage 1, three groups of patients treated their depression with either medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. The results of this study really surprised me. Although all three groups experienced similar improvements in their happiness levels to begin with, the follow up assessments proved to be radically different:
The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!


 
You donat have to be depressed to gain benefit from exercise, though. It can help you to relax, increase your brain power and even improve your body image, even if you donat lose any weight.
A study in the Journal of Health Psychology 2 found that people who exercised felt better about their bodies, even when they saw no physical changes:
Body weight, shape and body image were assessed in 16 males and 18 females before and after both 6 A 40 mins exercise and 6 A 40 mins reading. Over both conditions, body weight and shape did not change. Various aspects of body image, however, improved after exercise compared to before.
Weave explored exercise in depth before, and looked at what it does to our brains, such as releasing proteins and endorphins that make us feel happier, as you can see in the image below.
make yourself happier - exercise
2. Sleep more a youall be less sensitive to negative emotions
We know that sleep helps our bodies to recover from the day and repair themselves, and that it helps us focus and be more productive. It turns out, itas also important for our happiness.
In NutureShock 3, Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman explain how sleep affects our positivity:
Negative stimuli get processed by the amygdala; positive or neutral memories gets processed by the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala. The result is that sleep-deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories, yet recall gloomy memories just fine.

In one experiment by Walker, sleep-deprived college students tried to memorize a list of words. They could remember 81% of the words with a negative connotation, like acancer.a But they could remember only 31% of the words with a positive or neutral connotation, like asunshinea or abasket.a
The BPS Research Digest explores another study 4 that proves sleep affects our sensitivity to negative emotions. Using a facial recognition task over the course of a day, the researchers studied how sensitive participants were to positive and negative emotions. Those who worked through the afternoon without taking a nap became more sensitive late in the day to negative emotions like fear and anger.
Using a face recognition task, here we demonstrate an amplified reactivity to anger and fear emotions across the day, without sleep. However, an intervening nap blocked and even reversed this negative emotional reactivity to anger and fear while conversely enhancing ratings of positive (happy) expressions.
Of course, how well (and how long) you sleep will probably affect how you feel when you wake up, which can make a difference to your whole day. Especially this graph showing how your brain activity decreases is a great insight about how important enough sleep is for productivity and happiness:
make yourself happier
Another study 5 tested how employeesa moods when they started work in the morning affected their work day.
Researchers found that employeesa moods when they clocked in tended to affect how they felt the rest of the day. Early mood was linked to their perceptions of customers and to how they reacted to customersa moods.

And most importantly to managers, employee mood had a clear impact on performance, including both how much work employees did and how well they did it.
Sleep is another topic weave looked into before, exploring how much sleep we really need to be productive.
3. Move closer to work a a short commute is worth more than a big house
Our commute to the office can have a surprisingly powerful impact on our happiness. The fact that we tend to do this twice a day, five days a week, makes it unsurprising that its effect would build up over time and make us less and less happy.
IT made me happy when my sisters found their new home without having to move in for a year with me. Even If I love them I felt a lot of preassure about that and didn't wanted to loose my privacy.

YESTERDAY, MY BROTHER CALL ME AND SHARE THE PROBLEM AND THEY FEELED BETTER AND SHARING MEMORABLE MOMENTS ALSO.
I was having lunch with my family. Since my childhood we have a pattern in our home, first everybody at our home has lunch while my mother serves and while we are on our last Roti she too joins with her plate.
I was little extra hungry. She had just joined with her plate along with my sister. I asked her for Roti. She said aWait I am making one for youa and she left her seat.
I held her hand and said, aMumma! I am in some cooking mood. You have food, I will make a roti for mea. She said, aWhy will you work in kitchen while I am here?a
I said, aI want to make a rotia and I left my seat. Sister popped up saying, have this roti from mummy's plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.a
I said, well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah.a I completed my lunch and started with roti, This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.
I made a roti and served it to mother. She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself. They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.
Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously. Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.
Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet! She was happy. Everyone was happy.It made me happy.
A third time I was happy was when my daughter wanted me to teach her how to drive the tractor. It was aqes ok me because she said I am a better teacher than her mom.
White walls and uncomfortable chairs arenat the greatest amplifier for creativity. If you're not getting the greatest results from your brainstorms, surely the monotone work environment has its role. Maybe a colorful room, with all kind of inspirational images on walls, a comfy chair and a hilarious rug will kick off that wild imagination of yours.
AT THE END OF APRIL ALONG WITH FAMILY WE PLANNED A TRIP FOR KODAIKANAL WHICH WAS A HILL STATION. DURING THE SUMMER SEASON WE PLANNED A TRIP FOR HILL STATION.

I found out that I am ranked in the top three of the rocky mountain region for leadership within my corporation.

this incident had happened last two months back.I lived in a joint family, i was aged 22yrs and i was working as a sales executive and i use to reach home around 6.30pm everyday as my office timing was 9am - 6pm, when i reached home that evening i saw my aunty crying with pain as she was pregnant and there were no one at home as she was alone. As i don't know what to do even i was also fully tried, somehow i managed to take her to hospital and later  she delivered a baby girl. That was my first time carrying a new born baby in my hand where i forgot all my tiredness and i was also appreciated by the doctor that i had brought my aunty at the right time nor she would have been in a critical situation.

Laughing so hard when telling a story you can barely make it to the end.When you've finished a really good book and you just put it down on your lap and stare into space for a couple minutes because you need to collect yourself and return to reality.Surprises. Good surprises.
Searching online for platform beds and memory foam mattresses that I plan to buy in the next month because I'm excited to get my new set!

Simply, I resolved a conflict with my sig. other, who planned ahead with me on a schedule matter. Because we regularly are at odds about schedule, the pre-planning resolution was meaningful. 

[Aside -- I realize the nature of my responses show that I don't need to be happy about having access to basic necessities, a family, stability, safety. I know I am in that way very fortunate.)

Honestly, I wouldn't even know who Pharrell Williams was if it weren't for the fact that he kinda became the voice of Daft Punk in 2013; he does the lead vocals on both "Get Lucky" and "Lose Yourself to Dance." But he's a musician and producer in his own right (just not in the styles of music to which I normally listen).

Last month, my mom and I were flying to an event where I was speaking. As I told her about some exciting things happening with Mo-mastery, Together Rising, and my book. she seemed quieter than usual. I asked her what was wrong and her eyes got watery. She said, Oh, itas nothing, honey. Itas silly. What? I said. Her voice quivered as she said, Oh, itas just that you and your sister are doing such world-changing, important work. Iam so proud of you. After I feel so happy.
Recently My sister came to India to Visit us. But For a quite while even before she visiting us, she has been suffering with few pains in her wrist. Initially she thought it was just due to workload. So When She came to India, she consulted our family Doctor . He reported after few scannings that she has Giant Bone Tumour (Giant-cell tumor of bone - Wikipedia) in her hand and Some Organisms have already eaten some part of her bone. So we quickly without any further delay Planned for Operation in which some part of Necessary Bone from leg will be taken and that part will be fixed in hand after removing the tumour she had. Later they thought fixing it with artificial Bone. On the day of Operation,We all family members were waiting outside while her operation was going on. Then Came Doctor and Said they needed Blood ( B+) because of the blood loss she had during operation it was making her hard to breath. I and along with My sister's Brother-in-law Rushed to Blood Bank, I decided to be the Donor , But they initially needed to check my Blood group and all that safety measures which took around 20 Minutes and They Needed Blood Soon and I Quickly Started pumping my Blood Out and Finally Reached the hospital and handed over it to them and the Operation took Place Successfully.

Don't Know why but that feeling which I Experienced while Traveling to hospital with my Blood in my Hands to my sister in need of it and tears were rolling threw my eyes is the best feeling I ever Experienced in life.

THE MARRIAGE FUNCTION VERY ENJOYMENT OF THE FUNCTION. THE CHILDREN AND RELATIVES TO INVITE OF THE PARTY O COOL. THE FUNCTION TO DANCE SONG ETC.
To provide a virtual tour to all the major tourist places in Kerala for my guests, I have decided to travel to these places purposefully and write travel dairies of what I experienced. This is the first in the series and I hope it will be helpful, for all on tour to Thekkady.

I have been to Thekkady recently with this purpose in mind. Thekkady is also called Periyar and sometimes known as Kumily too. Kumily is the place where we normally stay and Thekkady is where Wildlife Sanctuary is located; both are just 2 -3 km apart.

Thekkady is situated 170 kms from Cochin and it takes approximately 5 hours to reach there. For most of the package trips, we go to Thekkady after Munnar which is 110km away or from Alleppey which is about 140km away. The route is a combination of hills as well as normal roads.
Thekkady is famous for the wildlife sanctuary located here. There is boating facility at Thekkady where the boat will take you around the Wildlife Sanctuary through the Periyar Lake. One can see wild animals during this boat ride but need to be very quiet. Mullapperiyar dam can also be seen during this boat ride. Note that, Mullapperiyar dam and Periyar wildlife sanctuary can be seen only during this boating and cannot be accessed by road.

For a guest who opts for one night accommodation, try to reach Thekkady as early as possible and get tickets for boating in lake. Ticket availability depends on the rush on that particular day. Advance booking is possible through KTDC where they charge Rs. 500/- instead of 150/- which is the cost for for normal booking. To do advance booking for boating at Thekkady, you may contact KTDC Lake Palace on 04869 222014 or send an email to lakepalacethekkady@ktdc.com. They will respond back with their bank account details and you can proceed with booking. To take normal ticket, you need to be in queue and need to produce ID card and your personal details.
I was having lunch with my family. Since my childhood we have a pattern in our home, first everybody at our home has lunch while my mother serves and while we are on our last Roti she too joins with her plate.I was little extra hungry. She had just joined with her plate along with my sister. I asked her for Roti. She said aWait I am making one for youa and she left her seat.I held her hand and said, aMumma! I am in some cooking mood. You have food, I will make a roti for mea. She said, aWhy will you work in kitchen while I am here?aI said, aI want to make a rotia and I left my seat. Sister popped up saying, have this roti from mummy's plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.aI said, well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah.a I completed my lunch and started with roti, This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.I made a roti and served it to mother. She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself. They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously. Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet! She was happy. Everyone was happy.It made me happy.

MY FRIENDS ALL TOGETHER FOR GETOGTHER THAT IS HAPPY MOMENT 
I WENT TO COMPUTER CENTRE
I AM GOING COLLAGE  FESTIVAL   DANCE FUNCTION  IN VERY HAPPY MOMENT IN MY LIFE. IN REALLY ENJOYED 
so a couple of months ago I graduated from university - it was a really happy time for me, and although my family and I had already celebrated finishing my degree successfully, the official graduation day ceremony was really quite special, and a very happy day, for me and my friends. It was one of the last times that all of us were together because shortly after that two of our group left to go abroad and they'll be there for about two years before they come back home.
Seeing my dog who has end-stage cancer, running down the sidewalk towards me, acting like she wasn't sick at all.
me and my friends gone to a restaurant last month. there was a cute and good speaking server as a girl. she don't know our language. but my speake and easily to her. we are shocked. so i cant forgot that moment.
My much awaited desired prolonged Velankanni trip.

One of the greatest pleasures of being in Chennai is your proximity to a lot of one day getawaysa| and nothing more exciting than planning a trip.

Even though we are in the first quarter of the year I have exhausted my leaves due to our clichA(c) dialogue personal issuesa.

Now that canat stop me from holidaying ;-)

When I sat down to plan the places to visit on my bucket list the first one that popped up was Velankanni, to visit the shrine of lady of good health.

In times of sickness this was always on my mind that when I get back to optimum health I will go and stand face to face with this mother as a sign of gratitude.

Hailing from down south in Kerala the trips to Velankanni were often registered as tedious, dirty, long trips.

I decided to create a better memory and enjoy my trip.

I did my research on climate to start with, modes of transport, hotels food, mass timings, and other tourist spots around Velankanni.

For the last two weeks I have been doing my research on the internet about Velankanni and speaking to the best hotels available for tariffs.

Something or the other came up and my two day leaves were not working out.

I planned a one day trip.

Departure - 10pm Chennai the busy Koyembedu bus stand

Arrival at the holy soil a 4.30 am.

I rushed back from my hectic weekend at work and quickly packed my backpack with clothes and other necessities, cookies to munch on and water.

Not to give extra strain on my back I preferred a Sleeper bus. There were hardly buses to Velankanni (surprisingly).I took a non a/c sleeper bus as A/c was not available. The humidity currently is beyond words could explain. I kept my fingers crossed that I should not fall ill or claustrophobic in the bus.

I thanked all the bloggers and their wonderful reviews which were so helpful choose the bus and hotel I wanted to stay in.

I would be using the hotel only during the day to refresh and catch some sleep which I have been deprived of.

Koyembedu and travel from that super busy noisy bus stand was not new to me. I sat down waiting for my bus and remembered my college days of how reckless and daring I was to walk in to koyembedu buy a random ticket to Nagercoil and further take buses to Trivandrum.

Today in spite of all the planning I was worried,

The bus reminded me of a fish .Tall and sleek and way too silvery.

Even though these thoughts happen on my thought bubble I laugh out loud, followed by an embarrassment.

The sleeper was an upper berth and had sliding windows. The bus started to move and the air fought to gush in.

I didnt want to reach velaknni at 4.30.I prayed hard for a delay in departure contradicting to the prayers of fellow passengers.

I had a small talk with the bus driver and conductor and asked him if he could drop me  at amathakulama(this was the landmark the hotel reception gave me.

After a long halt at a toll before reaching Velankanni the bus pulls in to Velankanni by 5.30.The sun was out and I was a happy child. A proactive bus conductor asks for a couple of directions and drops me at VPN hotel in Matakulam or Our ladyas tank.

The bookings we done prior to my visit and they offered 10% discount plus complimentary breakfast after my sweet talk and enquiries.

The hotel was relatively new and the rooms were spotlessly clean .

I hit the bed and woke up at 8.30am.A quick shower and nibbled through a bit of everything on the buffet, took my camera and stood outside the hotel.

Being very enthusiastic and experimental that morning, I took a shortcut to walk to our ladyas tank.

I walked and walked through a dry dusty road with no signs of a tank. Occasionally there was a signage pointing to the direction I was walking to. I finally reached my destination. There were trees with cradles tied all over with bright yellow threads.

There was the tank with a metal covering and a cross and Hail Mary stencilled on it. I could look through the small holes and see a reflection of it in the water beneath.

I walked towards the Shrine of our lady of Good health and by then the sun was at its peak. Sipped from a bottle of water I was carrying and I could see devotees crawling towards the tank from the church as a belief. I saw an exhausted woman in the verge of collapsing on the sand. She drank water from my bottle and I proceeded to the church. There was a malayalam mass happening at that time and I took that as a sign from Mother Mary Welcoming me to her abode.

I sat on the floor outside as the church was full of Malayalam speaking devotees. Post the service I entered the church and I quickly tried to remember the names I had registered in my mind of people who needed special blessings.

I felt that I was pressurised to pray and not to forget.

I did my generalised template of prayer and prayed for My parents, grandparents, uncles ,aunts, cousins, their children, relatives, neighbours in all houses I have lived in, people I have met in all cities that I have lived in, my school, colleges, juniors , seniors , classmates, faculties, teachers, mentors, guides,doctors,people who are unwell, troubled, colleagues at work, bosses.

I have always found myself in a very difficult spot trying to pray in a busy church. I never get a Holy feeling or connect.

There is always suffering around.

Visited a museum near the church with pictorial depiction of how mother Mary appeared to the milk man .The church was founded its founding is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of Mary and Jesus to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the survival of Portuguese sailors assaulted by a violent sea storm.

I walked through the dirty crowded humid roads with fruit, shell, and pirated CD vendors and reached the beach.

The sipped some tender coconut water and clicked a few pictures of the ocean.

I ate raw mangoes and cashew apple.

The resinous cashew juice burnt my stomach as I walked back to where I could take a rickshaw back to the hotel. I ordered food to the room and slept. I was content that a long term dream came true and I was relaxed after the good sleep and food at the hotel.

I lay on the upper berth looking at the beautiful full moon from the window and the wind stroking my hair getting recaps of the day which has gone bya|in spirituality and relaxation. I would probably not want to go back to Velankanni but I have memories well etched.

I VERY CLOSED TO MY FAMILY, BECAUSE ALL OF RELATIVES TOUCH  TO TRUTHFUL. VERY HAPPY FOR THIS FAMILY RELATIONSHIP ...
the last 3 month can easly and enjoyed happy moment
MY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION ON 14/03/2017
I WENT TO KODAIKKANAL FOR OCCASION
Watching Full metal alchemist.
I was really happy when my son started giggling over a book that we were reading. It was a book about tickling, and he actually grabbed my hand to make me tickle him, while saying "tickle tickle tickle."
happy
Weare starting a new series on the Buffer blog today with great tips and insights from Joel, CEO here at Buffer. Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:
Today itas a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Iave started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.
One of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform the best when Iam happy. It really does change everything. If Iam happy then Iam more productive when hacking code, Iam better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.
Iave found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Iam not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:
1. Wake up early
One of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.
Through experimentation, Iave found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, Iave found I crave that early morning feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:
aI get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.a
Waking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.
The power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so thereas a lot of room to experiment.
2. Exercise daily
aWe found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less activea a Amanda Hyde
In the last three years, Iave gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, whoas a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.
Over time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. Iave also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.
3. Have a habit of disengagement
aThe richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal a Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement
As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which Iave done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.
getting drunk
I hung out with a frined that I had not seen in years.
MY FAMILY VISITED TO ARIYAMAN BEACH NEAR RAMANATHAPURAM
I WANT TO TEMPLE
THE MOST EXITING EXPERIENCE I GAINED WAS WHEN MY FATHER BROUGHT MY FAMILY TO EGYPT TO FURTHER HIS STUDIES 
I went on netflix and rewatched a few episodes of my favorite show.
I had heard many good things about Kerala from a lot of people and so when I decided to take a vacation with my family, Kerala turned out to be the perfect destination. Since everyone around me praised the place for itas beautiful scenery and the relaxation that it offered, I thought it would be an ideal destination for family bonding.
TravelTriangle was discovered via internet ad and I was attracted to their concept of connecting you with multiple travel agents for competitive quotes and itineraries. I chose Best Holidays India Pvt. Ltd. as my agent and was soon sorted when it came to booking a land package for my trip.
We reached Kochi at 2 PM and we were picked up from the Ernakulam railway station and taken to Munnar. On the way, we had our lunch and also saw a waterfall. We then went to the Elephant Park but, unfortunately, it was closed. So we checked into the hotel and relaxed for a while eventually retiring for the night.
We visited a number of places this day. First one was Rose garden and it was followed by a visit to the Mattupetty dam. Next was the Eravikulam National Park and the experience there was nice although we couldnat see any animals. The scenery and natural ambience there was amazing. Later, after coming back, we went for a massage and that was quite a relaxing experience.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.[citati

He left my school when we were kids and went to boys boarding school. He came in contact with lot of our classmates through  fb. And he even visits our school whenever he comes to the town. He insisted on meeting with me.. I knew he was a decent person and doesn't speaks much., a gentleman ,very intelligent, good looking, Never been in any relationship.  We met near my house then for sometime after so many years.. His reaction was normal.. We hugged..It was good. Then he got into NDA, so he visits his home every 6 months. We met this December twice and spended a day together. 
now here is the real thing.. He likes holding my hand a lot.. whether we were walking or were in the metro... He wasn't ready to let go of my hand. We went to movie together , there too he was holding my hand all the time.. and a few times he even kind of kissed my hand. He himself told me that he likes it when i asked him jokingly that whats with this holding hands. 
  i found it weird because though he was treating me special  but these things I didn't understand  because I don't think he thinks of me that way. I'm not able to understand  his psychology. Maybe he's a nan? Or pervert?  Now he wants to meet again this time when he will come.
Yesterday, i searched and watched my most liked good old tv show episode online, which made me feel so much happy.
I AM MEEAT MY HUSHANDS

Mark Greene joined after the single's release. The group then signed with the newly established Stang Records label, set up by Sylvia Robinson at All Platinum Studios in Englewood, New Jersey with her husband Joe. The group had its first hit almost immediately late in 1968 with "Not On The Outside", which reached #13 on the R&B chart and #57 on the Billboard Hot 100 (with Greene on lead vocal). Robinson then hired a management firm headed by radio stars Frankie Crocker, Herb Hamlett and Eddie O'Jay. The trio began promoting the Moments and booking them for live events in major cities. When Hamlett moved to WCMF in Rochester, New York, he booked the Moments exclusively.

 when I was in  Armenia, my cousin came from the States to visit me and my family, and after returning back from Armenia, she was still in town. It was a nice that she was in town all summer, now then when she flew back that was the last time I saw her. We havent seen each other in more than a decade in this april, 2017, we will finally reunite. It will be an emotional yet exciting feeling and I bet you we won't stop hugging each other. Were both so excited. The reason why we couldnat see each other since then was because of the constant schooling between the both of us among other things, but this year is the year that it will happen again. I still remember her sound and the ways she was with me, but I am sure things may have changed because we are much older. Were about 2 years between each other and were like sisters. We try to keep in touch with each other often from Facebook and among other social networking sites and as well as communicating on the phone. She is such a sweetheart. I cannot wait for all the cousins to gather have a huge family reunion at my cousins wedding. A nice picture is required for sure. October seems so far away, but I am not counting the days anymore and going with the flow. I donat want to put myself in all that because its something that I am trying to get better at with patience with going on trips and looking forward to them. I need to cool off on that, but I get so excited and this is going to be extra special because I will see my cousin and it will be one of the best trips ever in my life because its a family reunion.
when i first set foot on the plane. i was going to china it is have fun.

I needed a deep color red  pair of shoes, I had purchased an outfit and I needed this particular color in order to go well with the dress, I went to so many stores as looking for this color online, would not be effective. After three hours of searching, I finally found the correct color and I was able to stop searching.

i recently watched a hollywood movie that was more attracted me  and i watch that film up to 4 times. it was an animation film.
Last week me and my wife went out for dinner at a really nice restaurant, we usually arent able to go out so it was a nice change of scenery and we both really enjoyed it.
I went to the new Afghani restaurant that reentry opened and it was fantastic.
Walking my dogs on a clear day with a light breeze and low humidity.

Itas a trip to Kanyakumari from Bangalore. Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of mainland India and is surrounded by three water bodies. Bay of Bengal towards east, Indian Ocean in south and Arabian Sea in west. I think it is the only place to see sun rise and sun set in water bodies in India. Kanyakumari town is named after the goddess Kanyakumari amman, a popular deity of the area. Legend has it that the goddess Parvathi in one of her incarnation as devi Kanya did penance on one of the rock of this landas end to obtain the hand of lord Siva. Tip of the day a Never ever wear any footwear which is difficult to open in Kanyakumari like sneakers or other shoes. Every place you visit, you have to open your shoe even in museum. 2nd tip of the day a Always wear socks to protect your feet from heat. 3rd tip a Protect yourself with best sunscreen lotion you have. 4th one a everybody speaks Hindi. 5th one a Hardly any non veg restaurant. Everyone is veg and I figured out only one non veg which became my favorite. Ok ok lots of free trip.

Its 22-March-2017 10:30 PM, we have boarded Nagercoil Express in Bangalore City Junction station. Since this train does not have any pantry, we had to get packed food. When I am traveling I am always double hungry than normal days. The train was full, but it was totally empty once it reached Madurai next day at 10:00 am. Runai and I were thinking whether the train will go till Nagercoil or not. Then I saw there was another family far end in the same coach.

We reached Nagercoil Junction station at 23-March-2012 2:30 pm. We came out of the station and saw lots of taxi waiting to take you to Kanyakumari. We know that they are going to take you on a ride if we hire them, so thought of taking a bus because it 20 KM from Nagercoil to Kanyakumari. There lots of local public bus very frequent to go to Kanyakumari. But then I came to know that it will take 2 hours to reach in this type of bus because it will go everywhere and will stop in every place. One person told us that if we walk a kilometer from there to reach highway, then we will get direct express bus for Kanyakumari and will take hardly 20 min to reach. Along with us there were another family who came to highway road bus stop. After waiting for 10 min, a bus came and we boarded that bus. Ticket was Rs. 18 per head and we reached Kanyakumari around 3:30 pm. We asked one fellow passenger to drop us in Kanyakumari Railway station. I had a printed google map of all the places from Kanyakumari Railway station. Anyway we got down and saw that itas the entrance for Our Lady of Ransom Church.

We decided to go to the church and then search for hotel. We did that promptly. Itas a beautiful church. A bit of information about this church a Located on the shoreline of the Bay of Bengal, the 100 year old Church in dedicated to Mother Mary. It was built in the Gothic style of architecture with a strong Portuguese influence. It is 153 feet high and is crowned with a cross of pure gold. One lady near the entrance asked me if I know Tamil and I replied yes. May be she knows only Tamil and wanted to communicate something important. She told me that behind the church, there is a staircase and on top there is a new smaller church build and we also get to see beautiful view of Bay of Bengal from the terrace. We opened our shoe and went inside the church. Interior was very simple just opposite to the decoration on outside. Then we went backstage and went to that new church which was pretty small and from the terrace we can see the beautiful sea. We could not take any picture because we did not yet open our luggage.

Next was our hotel search. Tell you something, if there are 100 houses for local resident, then there are 1000 hotels for tourist. So we decided to go near the beach and get a hotel. In the midway we found a budget Hotel Sangam. We wanted to enquire the rate and they told Rs. 1300 and 1000 for A/C and Non A/C double bed. We told its too much and we were about to leave and the receptionist told us, that they have room for Rs 600. Basically itas the same room and since it is off season, they lower the rate and I instantly booked it for 3 days. After refreshing we went to the restaurant downstairs. We did not wanted something fancy so ordered for 2 plates of lunch meal. Tell you something, I donat know what they gave in food but I till late night I was not hungry. So we decided that we are not going to go in that restaurant anymore.

We headed toward Triveny Sangam (which is the meeting point of three water bodies). I am confused here. Till now I know that there are 3 different Triveny Sangam (one near Srirangapatnam, another near Coorg and next is this one). If a traveler ask for Triveny Sangam details, where will the person refer to? Anyway itas a rocky place and no sea beach as such. There are plenty of shops for sea shells and they are pretty cheap AMO. Big shells were for Rs. 200 whereas in Chennai they are sold for min Rs. 500 for bad quality ones. We can have a so-so view for sun rise and sun set from here with lots of obstacles. After the sun set and few photographs, we left the place.
FINALLY BEFORE TWO WEEKS LOT OF RISKS TO  BUY  MY DREAM BIKE
Happiness or simcha (Hebrew: x(c)xxxaa) in Judaism is considered an important element in the service of God.[65] The biblical verse "worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs," (Psalm 100:2) stresses joy in the service of God.[citation needed] A popular teaching by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is "Mitzvah Gedolah Le'hiyot Besimcha Tamid," it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset

When my mother got a promotion in her workplace and was making more money.This made me happy because now my household has more monthly income to help meet the needs of everyone. She got a promotion and has to work more hours everyday so she comes home later which is good because she sleeps easier and makes more money each month. The extra money helps pay for my invisalign and other expenses so it is really nice.

In today's world we all seek happiness and can benefit from a little more happy in our lives.  How does one go about doing that and where do you start ? How about creating a happy movement for yourself ? The how, in a word it starts with your PASSION. What are you passionate about? When you think of your passion often times itas your hobby and not necessarily your job.
Although my son broke his leg over the weekend we had no idea how bad the break was until today when we went to the ortho doc to get his cast. Its a long spiral break that has lots of surface to heal. So the doc said its good. He got a hard boot cast.

This poem of Drydenas, aOne Happy Moment,a is a very intense and sensual love poem to another person. To begin, the poem opens with the statement: aNo, no poor suffaring Heart, no Change endeavour / Choose to sustain the smart, rather than leave hera (lines 1-2). The speaker instantly creates a tone that he has suffered from the difficulties of love in the past (apoor suffraing Hearta and ravished eyes) but how he now cannot keep himself away from this woman (lines 1-3). Dryden explicitly states that he would adie with hera just to not live without hera due to her intoxicating charms, which connects to a common characteristic surrounding love in literature at this time: the heart is so infatuated with another it will disregard everything just to be with that person 
I think a key part of why learning new skills can bring happiness, is that you need to concentrate in order to make progress. The flow state has been found to trigger happiness.

 MY SURPRISE GIFT FOR ME
Today, my son turned 7 and I turned 23.  Yes, I had him on the day I turned 16.  The choices I made when I was a teenager were foolish, and sometimes I get worried Iam bringing my son up wrong.  But today I took him to the park to celebrate our birthdays.  He played for hours with a girl who has burn scars that cover most of her face.  When my son took a break to eat, he pointed to her and said, She's so pretty and cool!a  Which left me thinking, aI must be doing something right as a mom.a
They feel validated by stories in which a human believed a computer was wrong, ignored the computer's advice, turned out to be right and got a happy ending instead of the ominous "what if ..." of heeding the computer."There are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast horizon"--said Damodara, when his herds required new and larger pastures.



actually catching the nan hit
We had breakfast paninis and they were wonderful!
I planted some peony roots just a few days ago and today one is already emergingggggg.
There are times when it is difficult to find what our inner self looks for, I was happy to find that every time I fall at such moment, I question myself what I want?
I am 7 months pregnant and set a pretty high goal of paddleboarding out to a smaller island off of Oahu (about a mile) to swim in a popular tide pool. The day came as planned to do it with my friend and there was a pretty gnarly storm going out but we toughed it out and made it to the island and hiked around the side of the island to take a dip in the tide pool. 
I was very happy to rate my subordinates' rating for this year.
My blissful moments could be different from mine. perhaps when I come home, I get to greet the pet I have missed terribly that day.
The day my first daughter was born.  It completely changed my life

MY FAMILY MEMBERS VISITED ARIYAMAN BEACH NEAR RAMANATHAPURAM
yesterday i was out of gas about to spend my last 2 bucks on gas to move to another parking lot as i live in my car, a man saw my situation and gave me five dollars, which is not much gasoline but lasted my three days.
Bike Drive From my work place to valaparai Hill station. I love mountains , trekking and Bike riding. It was a blissful moment in my recent life.
When I went to machu picchu with my girls. 
I love hiking and since the winter is ending I thought I'd go hiking however I did not estimate how overgrown the vegetation would be at the park. I decided to take a hike up to the point of a mountain called bee rock. I'd been there in the summer when the trails were easy to follow but now in the spring there is a lot of vegetation covering any of the trailers up. I ended up taking a wrong turn and took THE most steep road that had climbing portions which I don't normally do and didn't bring the proper equipment for. But I kept going until I got to the top and everything from up top was so peaceful, the view of the city was amazing, the struggle to the top had all been with it. It was not too cold or too hot, nobody else was up there, just me and the rock and the city. Honestly I wanted to stay up there forever but then I realized I had to find my way back down.
I WENT TO TEMPLE.
Face Timing with my 2 grandsons yesterday on the eldest's birthday yesterday was a happy time.
We lost track of time. Days become weeks, then months. You made me live again. I am not expecting anything anymore but you bring me happiness each day, knowing that you're here again. I couldnat see you but I could feel your presence once more.

My cat gets what i call the midnight madness. About a month ago he was very hyper active so i decided to mess with him. I would hide behind a curtain then junco out and see him un across the room. He'd come back and try to find me again and I'd run towards him. This went on back and forth all the while I was laughing because he was acting crazy and was finally getting some EXERCISE in (he is a fat cat). The whole even was just so fun and playful. At one point I brought one of his play mice out and I pretended the mouse was scratching his cardboard scratcher to which he retaliated by diving onto the box and mouse. Just over all fun and happiness.
The last happy memory in the past couple of months has been watching my son learn to crawl for the first time. To add onto that, watching my two sons interact and laugh with each other like i've never seen before is incredibly heart warming. 
I WANT TO TRAVELS

Wearing Garlands to God , showing light to God  and eating a ball of their food through its trunk were something wonderful to see and very much enjoyable .  We are all felt very happy.

White walls and uncomfortable chairs arenat the greatest amplifier for creativity. If you're not getting the greatest results from your brainstorms, surely the monotone work environment has its role. Maybe a colorful room, with all kind of inspirational images on walls, a comfy chair and a hilarious rug will kick off that wild imagination of yours.

Sitting on your desk all day long could have long term negative effects on your health. And as we all know unhealthy people are not happy. A chair that makes you feel like youare in heaven, which keeps you relaxed while you work, can transform the nasty tasks in a breeze. And isn't this a great reason to be happy?

When I rode four wheelers in the mud with a bunch of new friends and had a cookout afterwards.
Before I start with the second thing I must tell you that I am a passionate traveller and  I love going to places where very last amount of people go or knows. It was 14th of April and  we were just sitting and thinking of where to go this weekend. I researched a bit and planned a trip to Maaldevta WaterFall which is in Dehradun, Uttrakhand(India). Everyone agreed and we took off. Its a 2 hours drive from our place and after reaching to a point you have to go on a trail which takes you through a dense forest. At first we went on a wrong path and after going on about 2-300 mtrs on an inclined path which is about 7o degree angle our sixth sense kicked in and we realised we are going on a wrong path. We came back and started started again. After walking for about 20-25 minutes we got a glimpse and sound of the waterfall. I can't tell you how beautiful it was. We increased or pace and when I got the full view of the waterfall I just stold there completely still admiring its beauty. It was so mesmering that I can never forget it my entire lifetime.

The pursuit of happiness is so crucial that we try a lot of motivational strategies to make our employees productive. Happy employees tend to work efficiently and effectively since they emit positive energy, it is for this reason why they have to have proper compensation in order for them to enjoy and love their respective job. If the employee is in the state of being happy, he/she is thrice innovative. These 25 little things can really make them feel important and they'll be dedicated to their respective work.

I felt very happy when I was able to get a special vegan treat at an annual conference I went to that others had non vegan items.  I asked the guy holding the conference in advance to please make sure they had options for me.  Thankfully they made a special salad and had special veggie treats for my afternoon snack.

It was my second visit to Guruvayur, one of the famous spiritual destinations of Kerala. First I went before my marriage with my entire family with a bundle of personal demands to plead in front of Vasudeva, lord who had rescued his devotees from Demons and miseries. 



I was excited with the ambiance of the temple and its surroundings. That was first experience in my life. This great temple is well-known for its epic stories related to its origin and its devotees. 



It was my two years planning to go once more to Guruvayur but due to several reasons I have been postponing it. This was my word to come once more to Guruvayur. 



We started our journey from Thekkady on early morning in my car. The distance from Thekkady to Guruvayur is 210 km and 5.30 hrs journey. 



Thrissur is well-known as cultural capital of Kerala. Thrissur is famous for its temples; Vadakkumnathan Temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, Paramekkavu Temple and Guruvayur Temple. Thrissur Pooram is world renowned one because of its peculiarities. It was also considered as the spiritual and cultural destination of Kerala. 



My mind was filled with joy and excitement that I enjoyed from my first visit. My grandfather, who died before ten years, was the motivation behind my spirituality. But he was a complete devotee of Lord Shiva. He used to wake on early morning and do chants of Lord Shiva. He was truly innocent and never uttered a hard word against anyone. He taught me to chant the mantras of Lord Shiva, Dakshinamurthy, the Guru of this universe. I have been practicing this from the age of fourteen but after I went to Bangalore it was stopped. 



We entered to Thrissur town at 6 o'clock morning. My grandmother reminded me, aWe are near to Vadakkumnathan Templea. I asked to a pedestrian, he showed me the way to Vadakkumnatha Temple. The temple is encircled by Thekkinkadu Maidan where Thrissur Pooram is conducting every year. 



We entered to the temple after parking my car on parking ground. The security person warned me against entering with my six month old baby. According to beliefs children below one year of age are not permitted to enter in temples like Lord Shiva and Bhadra kali. 



It is a big Temple by its surroundings and minor deities are located each corner of the temple. We entered in front of the sanctum sanctorum (Sree Kovil). It was my first time visit to a famous Shiva Temple in Kerala. The ambiance of the temple and its surroundings are quite astonishing one for any devotee. When we finished our prayers we came out of the central entrance. We saw a person approximately at an age of 40 standing in front of the main entrance and chanting the mantras written on the board placed near there. I felt the voice that coming from the bottom of his heart and each and every ending of those stanzas he was raising his hands and praising Lord Shiva. The transcendental spiritual vibrations embraced me for some time. I felt my grandfather was with me that moment. 



Time went a lot, we were wanted to go Guruvayur the prime destination of us but we forget it for some time. I have drove fast to get rid of the traffic. We reached at 9 o'clock in Guruvayur. 



The much awaited visit, but I was exhausted with confession. The crowd was almost double compared to my previous visit. After Nivedyam we entered to central shrine Lord Krishna in Balakrishna form. I felt myself awful that I could not keep my words. I started my journey to see Guruvayurappan but instantly changed everything. After prayers we went to Mammiyoor, temple of Lord Shiva. We were stayed one day in Guruvayur and after seeing Nirmalyam we returned from Guruvayur to home. 



I drove my car with a disturbed mind but after sometime I remembered my grandfather's words aLord Shiva and Vishnu are different forms of Supreme God aheada. 



Next time I have planned go Guruvayur first, but I do not know what will happen when I see Vadakkumnathan Temple in the midst of the city of Thrissur.
My new job is the next happiest moment in my life, I was hardly in search of a new job, but couldn't get through that for long time. Last month I got selected in an MNC, which made me happy a lot. Since I had worked hard for it God provided me a good job , thank God.

I checked the mailbox and had a handful of wedding RSVPs waiting for me.
About a month ago I gave birth in the most peaceful way. Before I was even pregnant my husband and I decided on a middle name for our little boy that actually means peace; isn't that interesting? It makes me so happy to experience a birth without the medical chaos my last one had. My last birth was a painful early (36 weeks) induction despite having an epidural (not what I had wanted)! This birth was a water birth without pain meds of any sort. I kept thinking it was going to be worse than it was, or I wasnat capable of doing this thing called childbirth without medication like my last. But to my utter surprise, it wasnat and was far easier and less painful than my first! Even my dear husband and midwives were impressed with my pain tolerance and joy and laughter between contractions that were apparently off the charts. It was an absolutely incredible and beautiful experience for both my husband and I. I wish I could do it every day; it made me that happy. 
My son had one of the main parts in his play. He delivered his lines with great dictation and it sounded so good. He was given top priority in his class.
I was happy when I ate my favorite meal, a calzone, at my favorite Italian restaurant.
I get to relax and watch the warriors play tonight at my friends house 
Got to see my grandson.Have not seen him since he was 6 months old cause my son n his mother do not get along.. Run into His mother n him at the store . He is now 2years olds.. May had only been a few moments. But it has made me to happy seeing him . giving him a hug . Telling him i love him n miss him. Cheerish the moments you get with loved ones.. Been a month now and i still am very happy i saw him 
last sunday we went to bullwinkles with our daughter and had a blast playing the games and just being in the life .
I chatrouletted with a man in Pakistan and he sang a lot of songs to me and I sang some back.

He interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes.They feel validated by stories in which a human believed a computer was wrong, ignored the computer's advice, turned out to be right and got a happy ending instead of the ominous "what if ..." of heeding the computer.
I happen to have a small interest in hummingbirds, and living in the old-town area of pocatello, Idaho like i do, people tend not to see many of them.  I was curious one evening last month and found a site on the little birds.  One had been spotted just a few streets away which never really happens.  Although I have been wishing we would have some at the apartments I live in, it also made me happy in that they might be fun to look for this summer. 
A month ago, my sister and I were traveling to an occasion event where I was talking. As I educated her concerning some energizing things occurring with Mo-dominance, Together Rising, and my book she appeared to be calmer than normal. I asked her what wasn't right and her eyes got watery. She stated, Oh, it's nothing, nectar. It's senseless. What? I said. Her voice shuddered as she stated, Oh, it's quite recently that you and your brother are doing such world-changing, critical work. I'm so glad for you. After I feel so upbeat.
I purchased a new video game two weeks ago, "Mass effect" for my playstation. All of the reviews were pretty sub-par, but i figured i would give it a chance. To my surprise, not only was the game fun, but is something that i look forward to playing (at least for the now) quite a bit.
I binge watched the new season of one of my favorite shows.
My family spoiled me for mothers day. I was happy all day.. They let me sleep in.. My husband n children cleaned the house all up before i got up . My daughter went and picked me some wild flowers for the living room.. We all spent the day together watching movies and just good family time..Husband and my son made dinner up for everyone. cherish your family <3
Ozma was happy to have Dorothy beside her, for girls of her own age with whom it was proper for the Princess to associate were very few, and often the youthful Ruler of Oz was lonely for lack of companionship.The creek where the whippoorwills nested, the rolling hills of wild flowers, and the soothing sound of meadow larks - they were all the sights and sounds of a happy childhood.

My nan got masters.
I decluttered an area of my office, and it looks much better.
I cleaned and decluttered my house, which has been very calming.
My neighbors getting evicted, i normally would feel bad in this situation but they are the most uncoolest people on planet. I have never been happier at the moment. 
Yesterday I was so happy because I heard one good news about my spouse. He got a opportunity to Delhi visit for office purpose.
I had a really productive meeting at work with my boss and supervisors. They congratulated me and gaved me the responsiblity of starting a new project. I was really happy. 
A is for Arabian sea. B is for beach. When these two come together in Kerala, you understand why Kerala is for Godas Own Country. Our debut visit to Kerala was a short one. And as cliched as it sounds, it gave us a complete understanding why Kerala really is Godas Own Country!
Free walking tour is the first activity we look out for in any new city. Here in Trivandrum, we were told of an active movement called the tree walka. We grab any opportunity of meeting and interacting with the locals. A tree walk sounded like a perfect way to do that!
During the walk, we met Anitha, who started this movement with other like minded tree lovers of Trivandrum. Every Sunday, they meet in a locality, select a species for the day and observe those trees. They have now undertaken a more serious task of conducting a census of the trees and creating a database.
Thanks to Anitha and her colleagues, we saw the original version of the rubber tree. Original, Anitha told us, was alike it would grow in the wild, without being modified for maximum rubber productiona. The only time we had seen it earlier was in the Amazon. Surprisingly, the rubber conflict was a topic discussed in our tour of the Amazon, as well as during the tree walk in Trivandrum! Some issues are indeed of a global nature!
I was really hungry, and a grilled a 14-ounce pork ribeye. It was delicious and satisfying. 
Letas say you choose a job just for paying your rent and you're waiting for a dream job opportunity. But, whatever you're doing you want to be appreciated for your work. And how can we judge a fish by its climbing skills? We canat.
Happiness is the best part of life, in fact, being happy is all we need. If you are feeling happy, you love to let your friends and family know about it. It is a wonderful feeling too, especially when you realize that they are glad to see happiness and smile on your face. Maybe thatas all they are looking for.
Our house helps little girl was struggling to get admitted in a school. The 5 year old was denied admission a few months ago to a local school because she was underage for the class. So, today I decided to speak to the teacher in charge and to my surprise she agreed to consider her candidature for the same class for the new session. This was indeed a great achievement and made me extremely happy.
today i bought 2 gold studs from a jewellery, which i liked it very much, which makes me happy.
one thing that made me happy yesterday was getting chipotle. I was very hungry and eating made me feel fulfilled.
I have a crush on this girl I met through an app and we've met about a month ago and have been talking since then.  I've never met her in person but we have facetime each other, well we had an argument a week ago and she didn't talk to me for approximately 3 days and I really thought that was it until she facetime me last night!  I had the best feeling ever it was like going to your favorite ice cream place and ordering your favorite flavor, I felt warm inside.

remember the sweet smiles that picture in her face.

MY FAMILY VISITED TO ARIYAMAN BEACH NEAR RAMANATHAPURAM

I was having lunch with my family. Since my childhood we have a pattern in our home, first everybody at our home has lunch while my mother serves and while we are on our last Roti she too joins with her plate.
I was little extra hungry. She had just joined with her plate along with my sister. I asked her for Roti. She said aWait I am making one for youa and she left her seat.
I held her hand and said, aMumma! I am in some cooking mood. You have food, I will make a roti for mea. She said, aWhy will you work in kitchen while I am here?a
I said, aI want to make a rotia and I left my seat. Sister popped up saying, have this roti from mummy's plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.a
I said, well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah.a I completed my lunch and started with roti, This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.
I made a roti and served it to mother. She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself. They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.
Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously. Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.
Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet! She was happy. Everyone was happy.It made me happy.
I WENT TO COMPETAR COLAS 
I WENT TO HOSPITAL FOR HEALTH CHECKUP.
I WENT TO Temple
Last night i had a wonderful dream of seeing colorful light flowers in a tree, which made me feel really very very happy.
One afternoon I was at the store. I saw a lot of traffic and people. I could hear the people saying, hurry up!aa I could smell junk food. I was feeling so happy because it was Halloween.

I was passing by the street and I saw this old lady who needed help. She was 61-years-old, as tall as a tree, and her shape was skinny. Her hair color was white as snow. Her skin color was white as well. Her eyes were brown. She had pink clothes. Her eyes seemed to be saying to help her cross the street.

People were crowding like an angry mob. Another thing I could see was people wearing their Halloween costumes like they couldnat wait to get their own hands on the candy.

Finally, it was late and all of the people went trick or treating. Then I helped the lady cross the street, so she could go buy candies. She went home to give out candy to the kids. Afterwards, she was happy that I helped her.
We all feel very motivated do our job the best way we can when we have a very good training program. Thereby you can receive better feedback  you can work more focused and you can improve your skills when you know you'll be rewarded.
like if you have just achieved your life's primary goal, got a promotion at the job or maybe you have successfully proposed a girl of your dreams, and she is ready to marry you. WOW! These are the best and happiest moments of life. Why not share it with your friends and family. Theyall be glad to know. So, nowadays we are keeping ourselves connected to our family and friends through WhatsApp.
The most happiest moment of my life is when my little angle Kirtesha come out of my womb...that moment i was just thinking "oh Pillaiyarappa (God) this is MY baby MY very own baby" n when the nurse place her beside me just after half an hour she was born her smell was so nice that i can still remember...

The happiest day of my life was when I got the chance to be one of the EMS. I felt like I was being carried away by them because the EMS are expert in lit as well as in linguistics. they are also taught to be a good citizen of our society.

It means when we get the desired one in our life, that is the most happiest women. the happiest movement is change to person to person and time to tie, as far as regarding my moment is concerned when got admission in BA. I felt that I would not get better marks in that because, from 10th I studied in urdu medium but BA was in kananda medium. But I didn't get nervous I studied harder I struggle more and practice more at the end I got highest marks in that. so it is the most happiest moment in my life according to me.

A friend of mine was on the verge of crying. She just threw herself at me, clutched at my clothes, and sighed with some relief as I held her tightly. I was overwhelmed she found comfort in my embrace. I was preparing a scrap book for another friend for her birthday. It had screenshots of our chats during the past year, photos, and notes. She teared up going through it and told me aI donat know what have I done to deserve people like you caring this mucha I was struggling at college, having a hard time studying and trying to get higher grades. I had an exam yesterday. after it a friend told me aIam proud of you! your persistance despite everything you've been through is remarkable and I admire you for ita
I WENT TO TEMPLE
I WENT TO shopping
Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.

Most people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.

But I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.

Iave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.
She was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.

But just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.

I donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.

I remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.

The earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?

Iam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.

And then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a

Holy cow.

The joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a

I knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.

Since that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.

I think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.

In sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.

And Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.
I won a game of PlayerUnknown's Battleground.
Had a record day on mturk earning for 30 dollars in one day
Drinking a ginger tea , thatas all there is , this week hasn't been very exciting or happy , in fact itas been rather tiring and stressful but itas fine , a cup of tea can fix anything.
I was able to see my girlfriend last night. 
The warriors are making it to the finals 
My happiest moment was when I gave birth to my son. After nine long months of waiting to meet him, at last that day came. I was just so happy, and its unexplainable!
I am went the mahal .i purchase many things for my own use.i am very happy to spend that time 
Talking to a girl im interested in over facetime 
An event that made me happy was going out to dinner with my sister and celebrating her birthday at one of our favorite restaurants.
Had a surprise samosa(an indian tasty snack) brought by an unexpected friend. i was little hungry in the evening and was a bit lazy to prepare anything so was thinking to order something but out of no where one of my friend visited me and he had few samosas his room mates. During our chat i just asked him i am ordering something to eat you want anything, he said hey man i have samosas, sorry i forgot to ask. i was like whaaaat...thanks buddy. 
I went to thirupati temple with my friends last week, we were spend there 2 days and were roaming all over the place.
I'm going to make myself a sandwich and get back to work.No matter how sorry Alex was for what happened, or how many times he apologized or tried to make up for it, he couldn't remove the hurt.Sure, he'd had some rough times, but she had never done anything to make him think she would be unfaithful.More than that, he was willing to make concessions - in front of the children.It shouldn't make any difference if he's adopted.They didn't make it to the restaurant.
I went to catsit for my friend who is in europe, and her cat was so happy to see me... she really trusted me, and she lay on the ground while I gave her a thorough petting... she was purring the entire time
I made some sugar cookies.  I used coconut oil in them instead of plain old vegetable oil and the coconutty flavor really made them good.  Then, I dipped the cookies in some coffee which was even better.  
eating a delicious lunch with fresh deli  meats
My cat, Tripp, mrrrwd at me, stretching up to me sitting at my desk chair, and asked me to pet him.
I was in the bathroom when my 3 year old daughter woke up. I called out to let her know where I was, and she came down to the bathroom door and repeatedly asked if I was done yet. (This was one of the first times where she hadn't insisted on being inside the bathroom with me.) I told her, "almost," and she replied, "Can I just sit here? I'll just sit here by the door and wait for a little while." The way she said it was so sweet, and I like hearing words she can't quite pronounce. ("Little while" was said as, "yiddow why-oh.")

The next question asks how long the event made me happy and I wasn't sure what to choose. The event made me happy for a few minutes, but the memory has made me happy again several times today.
see in happy an 1 day in my life in wee good in my life in so good in trow in life we good and happening  my life we good in life my friend in good my life enjing in my life good ve to wee life good dring in my friend in ve good in my life last 24 hours in ve life we good life in my fuduy
Happiness is so interesting, because we all have different ideas about what it is and how to get it. Itas also no surprise that itas the Nr.1 value for Bufferas culture, if you see our slide deck about it. So naturally we are obsessed with it.

Sometimes I found that in my happy moments I could not believe that I had ever been miserable every gift, whether it warmed your spirit or brought you disappointment is a blessing
Drinking a ginger tea , that's all there is , this week hasnat been very exciting or happy , in fact itas been rather tiring and stressful but itas fine , a cup of tea can fix anything.
I found a friend who can dogsit while I'm on vacation.
My cat came over and nuzzled my face, it was so sweet.
My wife made me a panini today out of focaccia bread.  It was absolutely amazing, and the best part, I didn't have to make it.  
I was recently blessed to have a very special moment with the girl I love. Restricted by distance and various other constraints, we never had the chance to make love to each other. But we changed that this week.We have been in love since the past six years and always dream of becoming one someday. Both of us were virgins and had never experienced love making. We finally had the blissful moment and it was truly very special. I will always cherish the beauty I saw on her face when I was inside her for the first time. As I slowly proceeded and she felt me inside her, I experienced the change of expressions on her beautiful face. She felt pain from my movements, and watching her under me getting those feelings from me was eternal bliss. She guided me and asked me to go further, even during the painful moments. I could feel so much love between us as we proceeded through the act with just our eyes doing the talking. I could feel the trust, love & passion we had for each other in that moment. There was so much purity. We wanted it so much, and finally after years of patience, we had the chance to connect our mind, body and soul into one.I experienced the beauty of pure love with my girl. That moment of love with her is my life's most beautiful moment.

It was when I taught my Grand Mother to use my brand new iPad Pro and Apple Pencil and she was delighted to use it.One weekend, when I went to my home with my brand new iPad Pro and iPencil, I was curious to let my Grandma use it.That day, she was on her way to temple when I made her sit with me and taught few basic things of the iPad.My Grandma is wonderful brave and 76 years old lady, who successfully completed her 8th grade of those days (A great matter of fact in those days who was brought up by a Step Mother). At first, it was all fantasy for her. She refused to touch the screen or pencil. But, after a small demo that I showed, she volunteered herself to try it out.Here are some beautiful picture of hers trying this eraas gadget.The first thing she wrote in iPad is my Grandpaas name in Tamil .Then, she wrote all my family members name. I wonder she follows the order even in writing our names.
It was when I decided to cut my hair and be sober, that was a great experience, as i had once failed a drug test due to that. 
I saw clips of BTS winning at the BBMAs.
I was driving one day, and I gave some spare change to an old homeless woman I'd been pitying for a while now. I got a wide smile from her and a blessing. It felt really good to do something charitable.
aIf my dog doesnat like you. I donat like you.a And, aIf you donat like my dog Iam happy to lock you in a room when you come over.a Or, aLeave me alone.

I got all my housework done that I wanted to accomplish and was able to catch up on laundry!
played cards
I WANT TO READING.
I WANT TO HOSPITAL
The surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letter box.  The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because I was out when they called they hadnat been able to leave it, so Iad have to go and pick it up from the parcel depot.  I was intrigued.  I hadnat ordered anything online, it wasnat my birthday, and I wasnat expecting anything exciting in the post at all.  I had no idea what it could possibly be.  The next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and collected the parcel.  It was a box, about the size of a shoe box, wrapped in a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company ablurta on it.  I was none the wiser, I didnt recognise the company and couldnat tell who it was from by the wrapping. 

I waited until I got home, and then I opened it.  The parcel contained a brown cardboard box which said 'Buddy Boxa on the outside.  Inside, was a collection of rather random, but very charming gift items.  They included a pair of socks made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasnat too sure about that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus plants, a asew your owna cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook!  There was still no card to say who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying aI saw this and thought of you!a  It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone, somewhere to cheer me up.  Iad had a rather bad time recently following a bereavement and losing my job as well, so Iad been quite down, knowing that someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a surprise, made me very happy.  The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a very recent surprise, but a lovely one. 
i was very efficient with work today, money was good.
My happiest moment was when I gave birth to my son. After  nine long months of waiting to meet him, at last that day came. I was just so happy, and its unexplainable!
My husband was ignoring me and I laid in bed thinking of funny words with the word "sass" in them to describe him (like Sasquatch) - it amused me greatly.
One of the other redditor gets really excited when this HIT becomes available on r/HitsWorthTurkingFor and it makes me smile to see other people happy like I did a few minutes ago.

When I was able to catch the bus at the usual time. I thought I was going to miss the bus which meant I would've had to wait another 20 minutes.
my life my family has been very involved in spiritual practices. Finding my own spirituality and developping it has become a priority. It's almost a life project. I can often manifest feelings of incredible happiness within me, just when I think of the world and realize the way it is, and realize I am happy to be conscious of the way things are.

There are multiple reasons for being happy, like if you have just achieved your life's primary goal, got a promotion at the job or maybe you have successfully proposed a girl of your dreams, and she is ready to marry you. 
I became happy when I was able to get to the store to buy a bottle of wine and a few budritas.
I got to eat Monical's pizza pizza.
Being able to sleep has made me happy. I'm suffering from extreme vertigo when I lie down which brings spins and it feels like i'm on a boat rocking and on a roller coaster. It's the most awful situation. I have had a hard time relaxing and going to sleep. But I was able to get some sleep last night and that was very good for me and made me happy.
When my children were getting along and laughing and playing with each other.

I WENT TO Tempie
i go to temple and i say the poor man ,he is very hungary  and i help for him i am very happy
I started hitting harder and more difficult shots while playing basketball
Iall start with the where and when, because that makes more sense of the story.  It was a Saturday morning about two and a half years ago.  I went down to my local park near to where I live in Sheffield, to take part in a 5km run which is a regular weekly event called Parkrun, which lots of people in the UK participate in, there are over 364 different Parkrun events held in open spaces across the UK so it is quite a phenomenon.  This particular event is quite large, with around 500 runners - of all different ages, backgrounds and speeds a taking part.  On this particular day, after the run I was walking away towards home when I suddenly saw a face I recognised.  aHelloa, I said, ahello Lucya she replied, and that was the beginning of our reunion.  The person Iad recognised was someone I had been at school with thirty years ago in a completely different part of the UK.  When she finished school, shead moved away to Sheffield to study and made a home here, I hadnat kept in touch with her, so when I myself moved to Sheffield to take up a new job some 25 years later, I had no idea she lived in the same city.  We met each other completely by chance after three decades, and recognised each other instantly.  It was certainly a surprise!  What made it even more unexpected, was that we were both taking part in a sporting activity.  At school, neither of us had enjoyed physical education, or PE as it was then called, and quite often had skipped school to avoid it!  It was so funny to us both that we should meet up after so long, at such an unlikely occasion and in a city hundreds of miles away from where we used to live as children.  We went off for a 'quick' coffee to catch up, and ended up talking solidly for over 3 hours!
Like I said before, i'm going through a rough patch in life, so I meditate, it allows me to disconnect from reality, and lifts my mood, I meditated last night before bed to calm down and get happy.
I got some pop on sale at the store.
I WANT TO READ

I was having lunch with my family.

Since my childhood we have a pattern in our home, first everybody at our home has lunch while my mother serves and while we are on our last Roti she too joins with her plate.

I was little extra hungry. She had just joined with her plate along with my sister. I asked her for Roti.

She said aWait I am making one for youa and she left her seat.

I held her hand and said, aMumma! I am in some cooking mood. You have food, I will make a roti for mea.

She said, aWhy will you work in kitchen while I am here?a

I said, aI want to make a roti and I left my seat.

Sister popped up saying, have this roti from mummyas plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.a

I said, well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah.a

I completed my lunch and started with roti,
This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.

I made a roti and served it to mother.

She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself.

They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.

Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously.

Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.

Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet!

She was happy. Everyone was happy.

It made me happy.
I FaceTimed (videochatted) with my best friend for an extended period because he wanted me to feel better.
MY HUBBY'S BIRTHDAY EVENT MADE ME HAPPY. WE WENT TO TEMPLE FOR WORSHIP. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A HECTIC DAY I WAS HAPPY.
A few weeks ago i was in town and I bumped into an old maths teacher of mine. For this Blog I will call her Mrs A. Mrs A is quite a pleasant lady who always had a big smile and hello for me, which is kind of surprising and makes me feel a bit guilty for some of my behaviours towards her when i was at school. Back then I hated all teachers, the authorities. For me they were the enemy and Iam sure they didnt think much of me either. I recognise that I didnt give teachers an easy time I lacked the empathy and understanding to recognise that many teachers were just trying to do their best to do their job.

That day in town Mrs A and I had an interesting conversation regarding ADHD. First of all we did the pleasantries, asking each other how we were, Mrs A explaining she had been retired for a number of years and then we briefly discussed how great it is to see the sun. In Co. Fermanagh it is always a topic of conversation if the sun comes out because it usually never stops raining.   Then Mrs A asked me what I was working at these days and I explained that I was a founding director of Adult ADHD NI an organisation set up to support Adults and families affected by ADHD etc. etc.. Mrs A said well done Niall, that sounds like good work your doing. Then brightly laughing she said isn't it funny in my day there was no ADHD we called them BOLD CHILDRENa

Well I was glad she said it because I went on to tell her the following story, perhaps not quite as detailed, but she got the idea. It was actually Mrs Aas class that gave me a greatest understanding of how my school had failed me due to lack of knowledge or willingness to support students with various needs.   It was in year 4 that i ended up in Mrs As math class. Mrs As math class was what ye called top maths at my school. The maths class for the brainy students, the students that got everything really easy and the students that automatically understood how a2 + b2 = c2. So what the hell was I doing there? I was still trying to work out when they started adding the alphabet to sums, I must have missed that day. The reason I was there was due to the teacher I had from the year before. For this Blog ill call her Mrs B.

Mrs B was my ultimate nightmare. From the very first moment I met her at the door of her classroom Mrs B was screaming at me. At that particular moment she had no reason to scream at me but I can only assume that she had heard from other teachers that I had been a handful and she was not for taking any nonsense. Nonsense was my speciality, if I couldnat be nonsensical I had no idea what my role was. She ordered me to sit right in front of her at the top of the class and the second I opened my mouth she was down on me like a ton of bricks.
Finding out that there is no work next week because of company holiday nan ecstatic.

i found a treasure infront of my home. but it looks very dirty outside the box. when i was prainstorming to hold my hands because of scaring. then i had spend that box. it has gold coins inside the box, i was so excited and i  did not know what i do after wards.
To provide a virtual tour to all the major tourist places in Kerala for my guests, I have decided to travel to these places purposefully and write travel dairies of what I experienced. This is the first in the series and I hope it will be helpful, for all on tour to Thekkady.

I have been to Thekkady recently with this purpose in mind. Thekkady is also called Periyar and sometimes known as Kumily too. Kumily is the place where we normally stay and Thekkady is where Wildlife Sanctuary is located; both are just 2 -3 km apart.

Thekkady is situated 170 kms from Cochin and it takes approximately 5 hours to reach there. For most of the package trips, we go to Thekkady after Munnar which is 110km away or from Alleppey which is about 140km away. The route is a combination of hills as well as normal roads.
Thekkady is famous for the wildlife sanctuary located here. There is boating facility at Thekkady where the boat will take you around the Wildlife Sanctuary through the Periyar Lake. One can see wild animals during this boat ride but need to be very quiet. Mullapperiyar dam can also be seen during this boat ride. Note that, Mullapperiyar dam and Periyar wildlife sanctuary can be seen only during this boating and cannot be accessed by road.

For a guest who opts for one night accommodation, try to reach Thekkady as early as possible and get tickets for boating in lake. Ticket availability depends on the rush on that particular day. Advance booking is possible through KTDC where they charge Rs. 500/- instead of 150/- which is the cost for for normal booking. To do advance booking for boating at Thekkady, you may contact KTDC Lake Palace on 04869 222014 or send an email to lakepalacethekkady@ktdc.com. They will respond back with their bank account details and you can proceed with booking. To take normal ticket, you need to be in queue and need to produce ID card and your personal details.

MY MOM BIRTHDAY CELEBRATED GRANTLY
I finished my prelab for my lab class tomorrow.
I WENT TO TEMPLE
In summers of 2017, we planned a short trip to Manali and Rohtang Pass. It was a 5 member family trip on Ford Figo to the great Parvati Valley and surrounding areas like  Manali, Manikaran, Rohtang Pass.
The plan was to drive at night and reach Manali in the Morning. Since I was coming directly from my office, I would not drive in the night but I completely know the Manali route turn by turn as I went to Kasol many times.
I was late from the office and thus we could start at around 8 in the night. As to my relief I was not the only driver and thus with two people, who could drive, we took less stoppages. First stop we took at a Dhaba before Chandigarh. I forgot the name but it was completely shadowed by Gurdaas Mann's pictures, quotes etc etc on every thing in the Hotel. It was a great spot to stop by for a dinner and place was wonderful. Few pics from that Dhaba
We started and went inside Chandigarh City and got passed it, wont share much about the route to Manali as I have written about it in my many other blogs. Just keep in mind about those bad patches on the road.

At around 10 in the morning, we reached Bhuntar. Now we decided that one day we would come and spend at Manikaran Sahib Gurudwara but I suggested that we should cover Manikaran Gurudwara that day itself because its a different way from Bhuntar and just 40 kms from Bhuntar and if we come from Manali we would need to come double the way. So we decided to head fro Manikaran Gurudwara and got passed my second home Kasol and reached Manikaran Sahib. Few pics from the Gurudwara and the temple just adjacent to it.
Around 2 pm, we left Manikaran Sahib and headed straight for Manali and by evening we reached there. We already had a booking through Stayzilla and we went to our Hotel. Got freshened up and went to Manali Mall Road. I am not a big fan of Manali Mall Road and when I compare it to Mall road at Shimla, Manali's Mall road is not even a comparison. It was too crowded. 
We inquired about Rohtang Pass and got to know that there is a restriction of taking diesel Vehicles to Rohtang Pass and one needs to get hold of a Permit to take a Vehicle till Rohtang Pass, but since we had a Petrol Car, it was not a problem for us, as Petrol Car's number was lesser. But another issue happens with the family is over concern for everything and finally it was decided that we would not drive on those Narrow Roads but there is a Himachal Roadways Bus that leaves for Rohtang Pass at 6 in the morning. We would board that HRTC bus. We brought a ticket of the bus, Ticket Price was Rs 500 per person and they informed us the Bus Number. Next day Six in the morning it was raining and we got dropped at the bus stand by Hotel Staff and boarded the Bus and a long tiring Journey started.

In between one also need to rent a suit, a snow suit, I call it a space suit. We rented it for Rs 800 a suit. Again a tiring journey started till Rohtang Pass but the view was awesome. We encountered major traffic jams on the way twice and finally we reached the place. Bus dropped us a km before the main stop and conductor informed all, that Bus would leave back at sharp 1 pm.

Happiness or simcha (Hebrew: x(c)xxxaa) in Judaism is considered an important element in the service of God.[14] The biblical verse "worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs," (Psalm 100:2) stresses joy in the service of God.[citation needed] A popular teaching by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is "Mitzvah Gedolah Le'hiyot Besimcha Tamid," it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.
My happiest moment is my college days,because weekly two or three days we bunk the class and go to film, beach any resort. this is my happiest moment.

I WENT TO SHOPPING MALL
As I swam through the shiny, shimmering Malaysian sea, a glimpse of black and white caught my eye. As I turned my head cautiously I saw a black and white puppy falling off a wet, slippery jetty. I watched it frighteningly fall into the wavy water. I looked very closely and saw the puppy was in a muddle; his small black head suddenly went under the water. I stood there watching it happen right in front of my eyes. I didnt know what to do, my mind was blank. Then my brain suddenly clicked it was like it was shouting at me. My mind yelled sympathetically. I swam with all my might. I knew the life of the puppy was in my hands. I dunked my head under the water and swam deeper and deeper until I reached the pup. Then I clenched my cold wet hands to his fur and pulled him above the water. Once we were back on shore I grabbed my towel and I wrapped it around him and checked if he was breathing or hurt. Unfortunately he was hurt, his little white paw was bleeding he probably cut it on a rock when he slipped. I presumed he was a lost pup. I told my parents the story about him and they let me keep him but they did say that they weren't going to take him back to Sydney. That night dad helped me build a kennel for him to sleep in. We also gave him a name I suggested. Ziggy.

Each time I went for a walk on the beach with Ziggy, I always saw a little Malay kid sitting up high in a tree He never had anyone around him, he looked lonely. One evening as the sun was setting, I stopped to talk to the little boy. He looked sort of my age, ten. I asked him what his name was aSudia he replied. I liked his name. aDo you want to play with me?a His face gleamed, he nodded. We played lots of games and I told him the story about how Ziggy and I met. Sudi and I always liked to jump off the jetty but Ziggy wouldn't dare, he stayed on the shore watching as the sun shimmered off the water.

There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and out of those, I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with a little baby boy. This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.

My aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when the baby came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.

I usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying voice and then went near the baby. For the first time in my life, I felt a strong desire to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his little eyes. I thanked God for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.

My aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital.  This was a thrilling event for me.

Now I have a great attachment to him. His first word was my name. But that time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and that's why I cherish this memory very much

But I didn't get nervous I studied harder I struggle more and practice more at the end I got highest marks in that. so it is the most happiest moment in my life according to me.

Sunset is the time when the sun goes down and night begins. During the sunset, nature assumes fresh, bright, and charming. The sun seems to be a disc of gold. At the time of sunset, one can enjoy the serenity of a sunset. Then nature seems in a hurry. People finish their work and return home. Birds return to their nests. The cowboys become busy with returning home with cattle. When the sun sets, nature looks very beautiful. Then the nature starts getting dark. The slight darkness of the sunset creates a feeling of joy and tranquility in us. The beauty of the sunset helps a poet to generate any ideas and compose poems.

Morning walk is a good exercise. An early-riser can be a regular morning walker. The benefits of morning walk are manifold.

In the early morning everything looks fresh and fair. The atmosphere remains pleasant and calm. A morning walker breathes pollution-free air. He enjoys lovely sights and sounds of nature. All this soothes his soul.

Regular morning walk keeps one fit. It helps form a sound health. Science says that morning walk controls blood pressure, lessens stress and strain and energizes one to work zealously.

Now-a-days we are to live a very fast life. We are to work round the clock. We hardly have time to care for our health. If the habit of morning walk is formed right from our early days, we can be sure of a sound body and a sound mind.

Besides the health benefits, it is an extremely delightful experience to take a walk early in the morning

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand

But it should not be another "to do" item on your list.

Background:
Three weeks into my sophomore year in college, I worked a study abroad fair and found out about this AMAZING program called Semester at Sea. Basically you go on a cruise ship that was remodeled to be a floating university and study with world-renown professors as you travel around the world. Four weeks into my second year in college, I had a stroke in my brainstem. I remember finding the brochure for Semester at Sea and bawling my eyes out because everyone told me I'd never walk, let alone travel internationally again. Fast forward a few years and I'd recovered amazingly well from the stroke but now knew I have a genetic disease which was making me pretty sick. I sign up for Semester at Sea because I can be sick at home or be sick traveling the world. The later has better vistas. I undergo experimental surgery which dramatically (although temporarily) improves my symptoms, pack up my bags, and am ready to go.
As embarkation day got closer, I grew more and more scared that something was going to prevent me from getting on that ship. I was going to injure myself or get worse symptoms again or there was going to be a bloody hurricane or something. I had already tried to study abroad twice but complications from surgery had prevented me both those times. When I finally walked onto the ship, I realized that I had made it. I was about to start living my dream against all odds. And oh man was it worth every bit of work and anxiety and hope I put into getting there. It was the best and most meaningful experience of my life and it was even better because I felt like I had earned it.
I went to chipotle and the server game me way more food than usual.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.

It is difficult for me to explain a situation that has impacted my life. When God created the earth he decided that every person would be different, some big others small, some thick others thin. He also decided that everyone would have different behaviors. Some people would be shy and calm with little talking, while others the total opposite loud and more extravagant. Between all these categories I represent the shy and calm, for this reason it is very hard for me to express an impacting moment in my life. The most impacting moment in my life occurred many years ago when I started living my life fully and felt complete. My parents decided to register me to a public school in the city Guayama and I did not dominate well the language Spanish. For me this news was very impacting. One of the reasons I was scared of learning a second language I didnt dominate, another reason was losing all the friends I had made and had kept me company for many years but the major reason was leaving the house in the military base Roosevelt roads.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.

But not as beautiful as the food I had tasted before, I never find out who had made food. But I know it was the best food Iave ever tasted in my entire life, including when I use to live in Mexico. Maybe some one else could think that is just regular food, but they do not see it the way I do. Only people who had move from the place they were raised on to go live to a foreign country could understand what I am talking about. Seeing someone cook Mexican food, or eating makes me feel like I am back on my country. That is why Mexican food is my favorite food.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

The concept spread rapidly and First Fridays chapters now operate in 39 cities across North America and seven countries worldwide, including Austin, Binghamton, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Charleston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Myers, Fort Lauderdale, Hattiesburg, Hartford, Hong Kong, Houston, Indianapolis, Jackson, Kansas City, Kingston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, London, Louisville, Memphis, Miami, Nashville, Nassau, New Orleans, New York, Newark, Oakland, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond, Rio de Janeiro, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, Normandy, Scranton, South Bend, Syracuse, Tallahassee, Tokyo, Toronto, and Washington, D.C.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people.

Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing.

I strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.

I met my 9th grade English teacher on Facebook after a five or six years. She played an important role in my life and when I found her on Facebook, I was elated. She was the reason I began writing and she was the reason I actually enjoyed it. She had just started out her teaching career with us, and it was wonderful seeing her grow with us. She was fun, funny, carefree, smart, and magical. She was the best teacher I've ever had and I owe her a lot. 

When I found her on Facebook, I immediately sent her a friend request. I didn't think she'd accept my request or that she'd remember me, I was in for a sweet surprise when I saw that she accepted and she had sent me a message. It was something like, "Wow! It's been so long since I've seen you! How are you doing? You've grown to be a beautiful woman!" We started chatting with each other and I found out that she had changed schools a states, actually. She was doing well.

I informed her of my writings on Quora, my articles that were published, and my short stories (which I'm still working on a new one). She was proud of me, I mean, exceptionally proud. She said she knew that I'd grow as a writer because she could see the passion in me. I actually had tears in my eyes when I read her message. It was an amazing feeling to know that I've done my teacher proud, especially one that had a significant role in my life.

How does it feel to meet my teacher? It was amazing, I can't express the joy I felt when I found her on Facebook and actually started having a conversation with her.

My last 24 hours were not very eventful.  I'm really stretching here as the past 24 hours have been very routine for me.  However yesterday, I did finish a project at work.  I'm a Unix server administrator.  As part of my job, over the many years I've done this line of work, I have developed a number of computer programs (mostly Perl and shell scripts) to automate this and that.  Some are small some are big.  Because of a module that most of programs use has been deprecated from Perl, and because Red Hat 7, the operating system and version we are moving the servers at work to, no longer comes with that Perl module, a whole lot of my programs were going to break.  There is another module that does the job with a few tweaks to each program.  Over the past few days I have been editing all of my programs to update that module and a few other things.  I finished that today.  It is a nice feeling of accomplishment to finish something.  it was not a major project, but it's still an accomplishment.  I'll take that!

Minimizing stress is a key issue in the frantic, changing 21st century world. People under stress are not alert to what is happening around them, and they are prone to oversights and mistakes. Establish a network of mutual support in your company, so people do not feel isolated and know how to get help when they need it.

Encourage confidence.
It's never about the place. It's about the people you spend time with. I have never been much happier.

Wayanad is one of the most popular hill stations in Kerala and has a lot to offer for the visitors in terms of natural beauty in the form of hills, valleys, lakes and much more. I am sharing my recent travel experience to Wayanad.
While returning from our vacation in Ooty, we chose to drive via Gudaloor and spent a few days in Wayanad. Along with Munnar, Wayanad is considered as one of the best hill station destinations in Kerala. While going to Ooty, we drove from Kochi via Coimbatore and there was nothing much exciting in the travel other than the pleasant hills awaiting us! But the return journey was amazing. The drive from Ooty to Wayanad via Gudaloor can't be described in words. You must drive that route to enjoy the real beauty of nature in south India.

After enjoying a drive of about 4 hours through the mist and enjoying the beauty of nature to its best, we reached Lakkidy, which is considered to be the gateway of Wayanad. Lakkidi is a small town along the national highway and is located just above the Wayanad Ghat Pass (Thamarassery ghat) and is the first place after you enter in to the boundary of Wayanad.
One interesting thing I learnt during my visit to Wayanad was, there is no specific town called "Wayanad". Instead, a large area of hills, valleys, villages and towns together are called Wayanad, which is politically called as Wayanad district. While driving from Ooty to Wayanad, we were asking for directions to Wayanad and different people showed us different directions since all those places were part of Wayanad. 

During our visit, we stayed in The Wayanad Gate Hotel for a night and we really enjoyed our stay there. Read my review of Pepper Wayanad Gate Hotel and see how we liked the place. Also, check out the budget resorts in Wayanad, where you can experience a little bit of Wayanad within the property itself.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.

I am an avid reader.  I track the number of books and page count of every book I read.  I have been doing this every year since December 2003.  I've read an impressive number of books since then if I say so myself!  Every month, I look at my reading numbers, especially the number of pages read.  I have an unofficial goal of reading 100 pages a day.  I have yet to reach the goal of 100 pages a day for every day of the year (36,500 pages for the year).  At the end of March, I was 200 pages over that rate which means I have read over 100 pages a day so far this year.  Normally by the end of March I am already behind that goal.  Like I said, only of interest to me, but even so, it's an accomplishment.

I tend to memorize things well. With me being able to memorize things, I donat require a lot of studying. If I know I have a big exam to prepare for, I do many things to prepare for it. For example, in my biology class, I print my notes online before going into class. Then in class I take sloppy notes all over my printed out notes. I pay attention in class, and then when I get home I re-print my notes from online. I re-copy my sloppy notes on my new notes. Then I donat look over them again until the night before the test. I may, if I have time, look, over my notes right before the exam. I, then, take the test. Usually I make a pretty good grade: A or B. I can memorize the sayings that go with my notes, and that makes it a lot easier to learn for a test. I tend to remember numbers and things such as that fairly easily. As far as taking notes, I use PowerPoint for everything I type. I can better my notes using PowerPoint versus any other type of writing. It is neater, and I can highlight things better, and I donat have to worry about any words smearing. When I write a paper, I always make a list or bubble map of things I need to put in the paper. Then I write down different sentences on another sheet of paper. I also type my first draft, so that I can proofread it easier. After correcting my writing many times, I type the final paper. Once again, I always make a list (brainstorm) of things I am going to be writing about. I find it very helpful.

Happiness is a mental or emotional state of well-being defined by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy.[1] Happy mental states may also reflect judgements by a person about their overall well-being.[2] A variety of biological, psychological, economic, religious and philosophical approaches have striven to define happiness and identify its sources. Various research groups, including positive psychology and happiness economics are employing the scientific method to research questions about what "happiness" is, and how it might be attained.

I have a spreadsheet that tracks all of my debts, mortgage, credit card, etc.  I used to check the numbers every 3 - 6 months.  This year, I decided to do so at the end of every month.  It is a very effective way to get feedback on how well I am or how poorly I am at paying down debt.  in the month of March, my total debt went down by nearly $2000.  That's not normal.  Usually the decrease is far less, or even worse, my numbers go up.  It won't happen every month, and it certainly won't be as much as this past month very often, but it sure is nice when it does happen!

In fact, happiness meant "prosperity, thriving, wellbeing" in the 18th century.[5]

We went to picnic at 10 a.m. We reached there in two hours because there was heavy flow of traffic. The picnic spot was also crowded. As it was a sunny weekend of winter, there were lots of people who had occupied the place. We too identified the place under the banyan tree. We laid our carpet there. We took out our snacks and other edibles which we had brought with us. First, we enjoyed a light refreshment. We had also brought camera with us. We took snaps in different poses. We listened to music. We danced and played also. But meanwhile the moment of enjoyment was interrupted by the loud cries of the people. We rushed to the cries and we were shocked to see that a small boy was drowning in the canal. He was crying for help.

One of my friends is well versed in the art of swimming. He immediately jumped into the canal. After a great struggle, he dragged him out of the canal. He was in a very critical condition. He was rushed to the hospital. With immediate care, his life could be saved. We postponed the whole programme in the midway and accompanied the sick boy. But we were pleased to see him regaining consciousness. The saving of one life was a source of tremendous pleasure.

Thus, it was a day of mixed pleasure. Not only a life was secured due to our timely help and assistance but it marked an important day in my career. The memory of this day is as fresh in my mind as if it has happened today.

I think other people are going to say this, but it's true.  Seeing this HIT be available again is a bit of a happiness.  I am a casual Turker that can go for weeks or months without doing any jobs.  The reason for that is I get turned off by a lack of good jobs that are not tedious jobs that ask dozens of questions with little compensation.  When I see good jobs like this one, it does motivate me to do other jobs.  I do like the idea of furthering science and related fields.  The (social?) science related jobs like this one are more meaningful than the jobs that ask you to go go google and search for stuff.  Furthermore, if the RIT in the requester name stands for "Rochester Institute of Technology" then you and I have something in common.  I'm a RIT alumnus and have been working there on staff for 20+ years.  If you are part of the same RIT, then it is even better that I'm helping out a fellow member of the RIT community.  It you're not part of the same RIT, that's cool as well.  Happy to help.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

Kissed my girlfriend last night before dropping her off at home. 
On a holiday, I was sitting in my room after finishing my home work. As my friends were away to hill stations, I was feeling very lonely. I watched the cars and other vehicles passing by and wished that like my friends, I would also have been travelling or passing my time.

While my mind was occupied with thoughts of holidays and having fun with my friends, the door bell rang. I ran to answer it and found the postman with a parcel and a letter for me.

I signed the paper and took the parcel. My hands were itching to open the packet as my curiosity knew no bounds. I ripped the parcel open and found a beautiful tape recorder in it. The parcel had been sent from the United States and the letter along with it was from my uncle who had sent me that wonderful gift.

However, even more joy than receiving the tape recorder was the letter which my uncle had written. The letter was an invitation to go to the United States for my holidays. My uncle had arranged everything for me-the tickets and the visa, and I already had a passport.

My heart skipped several beats as I ran to give this great news to my mother. She was taken aback initially and her first reaction was not so positive.

However, she thought about it, consulted my father who was at his office and they both agreed to allow me to go to the United States to spend the rest of my holidays with my uncle.

I jumped from room to room and started packing my clothes, my toys, my books and other articles that I would need on the flight and in America. My mind was filled with various ideas about how I would spend my time with my cousins. I started dreaming about Disney world, Universal studios, the Statue of Liberty, the Grand Canyon and all the other tourist attractions that I had read about in magazines.

My father took me shopping the same day because he felt that I would need some more things to take with me. We bought gifts for my cousins and my uncle and aunt and when I came back home my cupboard was full of new clothes, shoes, gifts, etc.

Since I had not expected any such thing to happen to me, and I had been feeling sorry for myself, this offer came as a great surprise. This was indeed the happiest day of my life and I don't think I shall ever forget it as long as I live.
I finally ate fast food after cooking all week.

And I can remember one vacation with my family by the seashore when I was very young, when my grandmother showed me how to dig for clams, as well as a trip to Disneyland where we stayed in a loft with a circular staircase surrounded by orange trees. All of these memories leave me with happy, warm feelings about my childhood. I also remember playing with my brothers and reading in my room a lot and other minor incidents, but these more mundane memories don't really carry the same emotional weight.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way

Try to put on some music an hour or so before to relax you. Bring along your favorite CD. The shop may or may not allow you to play it. If not, bring an iPod or discman. You will want to be as relaxed as possible. Let your artist know it is your first and they will try to make the experience a good one! Try striking up a conversation with the artist during the tattoo to take your mind off if it. You will probably be a little nervous, and anything to take your mind off the situation helps! Also, call ahead and ask if a friend will be allowed with you. Some artists allow others in the room; other shops are strict and have rules against anyone else being in the room. If you can, bring a friend.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.

Arriving home today from visiting friends in Tennessee. Not that I do not love them very dearly; but Greyhound bus Terminals and the Buses themselves could give Hell a run for its money. I cannot even begin to describe how uncomfortable the seats are, and that is even when not having anyone sit beside you. And the 12 hour lay over in Nashville trying to sleep on metal seats to pass the time. But worst of all was my initial bus was late which made me miss my connection to Knoxville hence why had a 12 hour layover in Nashville. Not to mention they didn't even try to make good in any fashion. Hell a food voucher so I could eat during these 12 hours would at least have been something!

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing.

 Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Cooteas Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. Thatas when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that canat be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

The world seems to want us to be sad and angry because bad things frequently happen. But I say we should feel the opposite. We should be happy and cheerful because good things happen. We should be delighted to see the sun rise and stars glow and rainbows color stormy skies. We should savor every simple breath and eat each meal with gratitude. We should slumber in sweet dreams and relish moments of laughter and love. We should take more notice of the joys and kindnesses that do exist, still dictating the actions of millions of good people all over the world. Life is filled with pleasant moments, not just grief. We should be happy because this is true.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way

My old school is an unforgettable place for me because I have lived the best years of my life in it. I had a lot of friends, and I was taught by great teachers. So I would like to share with you everything I remember about my old school. 

My school was ordinary school. What makes it special is the feeling one can experience as he would enter the front door of the school. The loud voices of the students laughing, screaming, and chatting is all what you can hear before the bell ranges.

Usually first classes are the worst. Students find themselves sleepy and lazy itas the classes which I take advantage of to stare everywhere in the classroom. The first thing that could be observed at my classroom is the stunning graphic design by my classmate Layla which occupying the left corner of the classroom. The hardwood table is in the right corner. we usually gather around the table for reading 'free reading' as I like to call it. For this day's free reading we prepared: Harry Potter, Animal Farm, and Wuthering Heights.

As you first walk into the vast yard of my old school a feeling of hunger will attack your stomach. A scent that you have never smelled begins to enter your lunges. It is a sort of smell that convinces you that you must eat in the school cafeteria. Hajer is the cafeteria cook, and she was an excellent cook.

My best teacher told me once: ' the best places are the places that we donat feel how amazing they were except when we leave them'. That what happened to me eventually because I never knew how great Hajer the cook is, or how joyful the free hours reading was except when I left my old school.

I was texting my boyfriend who never really has been a big texter, but because I was at work, we couldn't talk on the phone like we usually do. I sent him a sweet text before my shift started and kept checking my phone throughout to see if he had responded. I eventually decided that it wasn't a big deal and he was probably busy. So as soon as I clocked out and was walking out to my car, I checked my phone and there was a long, novel-like, text from him. It said all these sweet things with things he liked about me and how happy he is with me. We've been dating a while but I still get butterflies when I'm with him and I fall for him more each day. We do have a long distance relationship so it's difficult sometimes but he does sweet things every time I see him that make it worth it. So  Just walking out to my car and reading that text over and over, really just made my night and made me so happy.

Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority. If you think someone else is better than you, you end up feeling bad about yourself. You'll be happier if you focus on your own progress and praise others on theirs.

This is the second essay in a two-part series about my journey to visit the Taj Mahal. Read the first part for the whole story.

A
GRA, Uttar Pradesh, India -- As soon as my train to Agra leaves from Delhi, I find myself confused again. I'm lying on my reserved upper berth, though most of the train car beds aren't being used and almost all of the passengers are sitting on lower seats. I feel ridiculous, like I'm emperor of my train car, overseeing the rest of the passengers from above. Meanwhile, men pass by below me, offering a mysterious vegetarian curry out of industrial-sized buckets. I motion for one to serve me some on a paper plate, but when I try to pay for the food, he won't accept any money. This is the first time I've gotten anything for free in India. I conclude that the food is going to kill me.

While I'm eating, the train makes a stop and passengers disembark, but the conductor makes no announcements. I can't see through any of the train's tiny lower windows from my upper bunk. I have no idea where I am.

"Is this Agra?" I ask a man sitting below me. I ask as nicely as possible, in an attempt to avoid appearing as a self-righteous train car emperor, shouting questions to my serfs. After all, I remember, Taj Mahal-builder and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son soon after the Taj Mahal's completion. The man below shakes his head and, in Hindi, I think he tells me that we still have a long ride to Agra. Another man walks by selling non-vegetarian food in foil tins. The first shots of an intestinal war have already been fired as a result of my free bucket food, so I decline. As the train chugs toward Agra, stopping at stations along the way, I find myself continuously recruiting new serfs below me to keep track of where we are. By the time I'm halfway through the journey, I have an eighteen year old kid, two Indian soldiers, and a young woman -- none of whom can speak English -- trying to assist me. It's easy to accidentally aggregate helpers on the train; mercifully, Indians tend to be especially protective of clueless Westerners trying to make sense of Indian public transportation. At one point, the two Indian soldiers demand that a teenager move his feet resting on my berth, and the young woman makes food recommendations as buckets whisk by. They're kind of like four Train-Fairy Godmothers. Soon, I fall asleep.

Suddenly, I awake to the sound of four Indians chanting "Agra! Agra!" in unison. I abruptly end my time as train car emperor, jump down from my bed, thank the four of them, and catch a taxi to my Agra guesthouse. Before he leaves, I arrange for my taxi driver to pick me up at 6 AM the next morning to take me to the Taj Mahal.

In the morning, I tell my driver to take me to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. He promptly takes me to a roundabout near the West Gate instead -- though his "East Gate!" announcement upon our arrival is quite convincing. India's perpetually dishonest taxi drivers always have ulterior (and sometimes mysterious) motives; in this case, he was trying to save gas by taking me to the Gate closer to my hotel and, according to Lonely Planet, possibly collect a kickback from camel and rickshaw drivers sitting near the West Gate waiting to take tourists to the Taj's ticket office. I don't bother to argue with him since there's not much time until sunrise, and I walk quickly to the entrance. Standing in line with about twenty other mostly Indian tourists, I'm surprised to see a lack of Westerners -- I imagined that every white person in India would be flocking to the Taj Mahal.

Finally, the doors open, and I catch my first glimpse of the building considered to be the most beautiful in the world, one whose creator boasted that it made "the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes." I see the famous white, marble dome peeking through the arch of the Great Gate as tourists hold cameras high above their heads to get their first snapshot. I walk deliberately toward and around the Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle. A handful of photographers gather in front of the adjacent Taj Mahal mosque with me to capture the sun as it rises behind it. Everyone is reverent, taking care not to interfere with others' photographs and offering to help take posed pictures. The moment is perfect for the photographer gaggle: mist blankets the Yamuna River behind the structure, and the building looks like it has risen spontaneously from a clouded heaven, a concrete manifestation of nirvana.

The simple presence of the Taj, built as a symbol of eternal love by Emperor Jahan in memory of his third wife who died during childbirth, seems to encourage even rabid photographers to cooperate with each other.

I spend almost two hours touring and photographing the Taj, walking around its walls, admiring the calligraphy on the entrance arch, gazing at the minarets, and touching the intricate lattice screens in the mausoleum interior. I'm just about finished, taking a few final classic Taj Mahal reflection pool photographs from outside, when a beautiful, young blond woman performing playful, provocative poses for her friend's camera catches my eye. Soon, a string of Indian men, and some Indian families too, start interrupting to ask her to pose with them in souvenir photos.

"The Indian tourists seem more interested in your white skin and blond hair than the white marble of the Taj Mahal," I say to her. "I'm pretty sure a lot of these Indian guys are leaving with more pictures of you than the Taj."

She chuckles and introduces herself to me as Sophie, from France, and, quickly, we're trading funny stories of our travels through India. We like each other immediately. We find ourselves chatting in front of the Taj's reflection pool for about a half hour as Indian men gawk at us. But when Sophie and I realize that we're headed in opposite directions -- she toward Amritsar in northern India and me toward Kerala in southern India -- we share an awkward moment during which we realize that this is the one and only meeting of our entire lives.

"Well, it truly has been a pleasure, Hank," she says. Her eyes hold on mine. For a long moment, she doesn't look away. I can't tell whether she's staring at me or at the exquisite reflection of the Taj Mahal in the pool behind me.

She walks past me, in front of the rising sun. Then, she glances back at me one last time, smiles, and then shifts her gaze, once again, toward the world's most beautiful symbol of eternal love.

A person meets many people in life but there are only some who leave a lasting impression in our minds.

There are people we can laugh with, cry with and depend on with utmost degree of faith. Friends make it easier for us to go through hardships and struggles in life. They provide a shoulder for us to cry on.

A very close friend of mine named Asha left the country when I was very young. She went away to the United States and thereafter I began to feel very lonely. She and I were inseparable in school. She was my partner in class and even in the evening she would come over to my house and we would spend most of our time playing together. Then her parents decided to settle down in the States and she left. I remember how much I cried when I went to leave her at the airport.

It was for a long time that I could not find any friends I could feel absolutely comfortable with. Most of my friends were a boring company. I began writing to Asha regularly. We exchanged letters every week and sometimes even called each other over the telephone. However, I always had the feeling of loss after she went away.

I wanted to meet her again and therefore asked my parents to arrange a trip for me go to the US. They found the idea ridiculous as they felt that it was too expensive to go abroad. My spirits had been quite low once my parents turned down my wish to go and visit my friend.

But they said that whenever we wished for something hard enough it materializes. And my prayers were answered when i got a call from Asha to say that her parents had decided to visit India to meet her relatives and that she would be accompanying them. My happiness knew no limits when I got this news. I eagerly awaited the day of her arrival.

I went to receive her at the airport and that was the happiest night of my life. We hugged each other and had so much to share. We talked the whole night and till the day she left we were inseparable again. Meeting an old friend after days of separation can be one of the most satisfying experiences of one's life.

Nowadays, happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people.

Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing.

Last week while at my full time job a woman brought in her very old, very matted cat. His name is Sheldon. She said all the other grooming shops had declined grooming him because of the condition of his coat, his age and his medical conditions. I told her I would definitely try to take care of her baby for her, and do the best job I could.  So, I befriended Sheldon and he was a very sweet cat. It took me over two hours to shave the dreadlocks of him and his skin underneath was extremely oily and was covered in dander. I could tell his skin hadn't had much air to it for some time. As I was removing his matted fur, I could see a transformation in old Sheldon. He started to purr and actually got a little playful. I bathed him three times trying to remove as much oil as I could from his coat and then dried him off. I wrapped him up in a towel to dry. A little while later I went back over him with my clippers and smoothed his coat out the best I could. I called his Mom and she came to pick him up. She could tell he felt so much better and there were tears in her eyes. She looked at me and reached out and gave me the biggest hug ever , thanking me for taking such good care of her baby.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.[citation needed]

Truer words were never spoken, and Lincoln nailed it on this quote on happiness. It's just a matter of making up your mind to be happy, and then from there never look back. Life is like a buffet and there are all sorts of things you can focus on. Some will make you feel good and others will make you feel bad, but the choice is yours as to which ones you want to give your attention to, and where you set your mood. Realizing that you hold the key to your own happiness, and that's it's just a decision away can be a real breakthrough.

Well, what made you leave your old job in the first place? Whatever the reason, it is most likely still there and not going to change any time soon. Considering that, it sounds to me that you are right in thinking this won't be a wise decision in the long term. Think about how hard, unfair and embarrassing it might be for you to quit a job you returned to after 3 months, for the second time. You should only go back if you are absolutely 100% sure you are going to stick at your old job for a least another year, if not more. If that thought makes you miserable - don't go back. Cause you won't be able to leave in a dignified way.

In his book, The Untethered Soul, Michael Singer argues that your energy should come from within -- from your why -- not from external stimulants. The scientific backing is substantial and unsurprising: intrinsic motivation destroys extrinsic motivation every day of the week.
Motivation aside -- healthy eating, sleeping, and intensive exercise produce higher quantities and quality of energy than caffeine ever could. A holistic approach to life is essential. Garbage in, garbage out.
Give up the caffeine and see what happens. To avoid withdrawal headaches -- which are mostly placebo -- replace your caffeine with something else (another placebo). After a few days without caffeine, you'll develop confidence in your ability to function without it.

Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.


During the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overjoyed to see and meet one another.

The following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.
The temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This "Queen of the Hill Stations" is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.

We went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle's car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Sam's Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.

The shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk saris', spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.

We also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.

Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.

happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.[7]

It does not matter what you are pursuing in your life, whether it is business, power, education or service, you are doing so because somewhere deep inside you is a feeling that this will bring you happiness. Every single action that we perform on this planet springs from an aspiration to be happy because it is the original nature. When you were a child you were simply happy. That is your nature. The source of joy is within you; you can take charge of it.

 As I can remember, when I was younger I used to held parties at my home solely with my family and relatives. Especially on my birthdays, my mom cooked my favourite foods and made my favourite birthday cake with chocolate. Now that I am not a teenager anymore, I go out with my friends and in some special circumstances with my family as well. For example, on my graduation day, I went to a Greek restaurant with my parents, brother and my five best friends and we had a really great time. Generally speaking, I would say that I am more of an introvert person, so I totally prefer to spend substantial time with few friends rather than having many people and typical relationships. My happy moments and celebrations are also related to my friends and family members. 
Our commute to the office can have a surprisingly powerful impact on our happiness. The fact that we tend to do this twice a day, five days a week, makes it unsurprising that its effect would build up over time and make us less and less happy.One of the most counterintuitive pieces of advice I found is that to make yourself feel happier, you should help others.

Holding a grudge has a lot of detrimental effects on your wellbeing, including increased depression, anxiety, and stress. Why let anyone who has wronged you have power over you? If you let go of all your grudges, you'll gain a clear conscience and enough energy to enjoy the good things in life.The happiest people don't have the best of everything; they just make the best of everything they have."

I had the most unforgettable experience in my life . It is an experience about helping a blind man to cross the street. I still remember that day vividly. That night I had studied at school library; it was around 10 o'clock, and I prepared to go back home. As I passed through the school gate, I said goodbye to my friends. Suddenly I saw a strange thing in front of me. There was a male standing beside the cross-walk; the traffic light was green, he could walk forward, but he didn't. He was just standing there and made no actions. I was confused at this sight. Out of curiosity, I decided to walk over to him and to see what was happening. I felt perplexed until I walked next to him. Standing beside him, I could see he was wearing sunglasses and holding a white stick; then I knew this man was blind. In this cold winter day, pedestrians all wore heavy coats, including him and me. His was gray and mine was black. I also noticed that there was a sign around his neck. The sign said "I am virtually deaf and blind; please help me cross the street. Tap me on the shoulder." I knew I must help him. So I tapped him on the shoulder, and then he put his left hand on my right shoulder and I led him across the street. All the process was quiet; the only thing I could hear was the sounds of our steps. It was a chilly night too, but I knew he would feel warm at this moment. When we got across the street, he bowed in thanks, and started walking up the block, to the next corner, then the next. While he walked past me, I couldn't help but start to weep. I wanted to walk him home. It was not a very busy street, almost deserted. He could have been there, on that corner, for 10 minutes. Maybe he is still at another corner, now, waiting. How does he get home? How does he know where his home is? Thinking of this, I cried more loudly. I can't image being deaf and blind. You would be so helpless and dependent on other people. Can you imagine going home like that every day: walking a block, then waiting for someone to help you get across the street, then walking another block, and waiting, relying on the kindness of strangers? After this incident, I realized how blessed I am. I should cherish every day and do my best to help the people who need help in my life.

There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesn't come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy. They maintain a positive outlook on life and remain at peace with themselves.

Happy people understand that it's better to forgive and forget than to let their negative feelings crowd out their positive feelings. Holding a grudge has a lot of detrimental effects on your wellbeing, including increased depression, anxiety, and stress. Why let anyone who has wronged you have power over you? If you let go of all your grudges, you'll gain a clear conscience and enough energy to enjoy the good things in life.

Existence is all mathematics," he says. "There's an equation for success in every obstacle."
I finally got my braces removed, and my smile is perfect
A smile never cost anybody anything and a day seems to go better when you are surrounded by colleagues that smile and are willingly to help you anytime or just to hug you when you are not feeling ok.If all the people around us would be open minded we would all have something to gain. We all feel very motivated do our job the best way we can when we have a very good training program. Thereby you can receive better feedback  you can work more focused and you can improve your skills when you know you'll be rewarded.

strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.

Well, what made you leave your old job in the first place? Whatever the reason, it is most likely still there and not going to change any time soon. Considering that, it sounds to me that you are right in thinking this won't be a wise decision in the long term. Think about how hard, unfair and embarrassing it might be for you to quit a job you returned to after 3 months, for the second time. You should only go back if you are absolutely 100% sure you are going to stick at your old job for a least another year, if not more. If that thought makes you miserable - don't go back. Cause you won't be able to leave in a dignified way.

She was fun, funny, carefree, smart, and magical. She was the best teacher I've ever had and I owe her a lot. 

When I found her on Facebook, I immediately sent her a friend request. I didn't think she'd accept my request or that she'd remember me, I was in for a sweet surprise when I saw that she accepted and she had sent me a message. It was something like, "Wow! It's been so long since I've seen you! How are you doing? You've grown to be a beautiful woman!" We started chatting with each other and I found out that she had changed schools - states, actually. She was doing well.

Watching the sun rise, getting a raise, putting a smile on someone's face these are all examples of when a person may feel a happy. They are all diverse, just like the individual's in the world. Happiness is acquired through countless stimuli, whether they are material or emotional. One can not give a general definition for happiness, due to the fact that each person has their own perception of what happiness is. Happiness lies in the eye of the beholder, and as the beholder I see happiness as:Thus through this essay I will describe what happiness means to me, by discussing the above mentioned. I have found that through completing my "Happy Moments Journal," that my family is a huge element of my happiness. Over half of the entries in my journal involved some interaction or thought of my family. A couple of examples include having Sunday lunch with my family. Everyone basically, comes together after church and we sit down and eat lunch together and then spend the rest of the day talking and just enjoying each others company. Also, going out with my sister and cousin on the weekends is always brings happiness into my life.

Yesterday i went to shopping, I enjoy shopping! It is a nice way to spend some time. Can be social. It is always fun to try on clothes, see how they go together and plan future outfits.

It is also nice to see the new inventions they create. I watched "The True Cost" that makes me question and despise a lot of things in shops now. I can't help but get drawn in sometimes though. The shops market things in such a way it's hard to not enjoy shopping.

Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority. If you think someone else is better than you, you end up feeling bad about yourself. You'll be happier if you focus on your own progress and praise others on theirs.

Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island.
