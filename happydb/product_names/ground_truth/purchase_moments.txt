Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.


During the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overAjoyed to see and meet one another.

The following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.
The temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This aQueen of the Hill Stationsa is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.

We went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle's car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Samas Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.

The shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk sarisa, spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.

We also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.

I enjoy seeing neatness and orderliness and every time I straighten up the garden it makes me feel really happy.

My much awaited desired prolonged Velankanni trip.

One of the greatest pleasures of being in Chennai is your proximity to a lot of one day getawaysa| and nothing more exciting than planning a trip.

Even though we are in the first quarter of the year I have exhausted my leaves due to our clichA(c) dialogue personal issuesa.

Now that canat stop me from holidaying ;-)

When I sat down to plan the places to visit on my bucket list the first one that popped up was Velankanni, to visit the shrine of lady of good health.

In times of sickness this was always on my mind that when I get back to optimum health I will go and stand face to face with this mother as a sign of gratitude.

Hailing from down south in Kerala the trips to Velankanni were often registered as tedious, dirty, long trips.

I decided to create a better memory and enjoy my trip.

I did my research on climate to start with, modes of transport, hotels food, mass timings, and other tourist spots around Velankanni.

For the last two weeks I have been doing my research on the internet about Velankanni and speaking to the best hotels available for tariffs.

Something or the other came up and my two day leaves were not working out.

I planned a one day trip.

Departure - 10pm Chennai the busy Koyembedu bus stand

Arrival at the holy soil a 4.30 am.

I rushed back from my hectic weekend at work and quickly packed my backpack with clothes and other necessities, cookies to munch on and water.

Not to give extra strain on my back I preferred a Sleeper bus. There were hardly buses to Velankanni (surprisingly).I took a non a/c sleeper bus as A/c was not available. The humidity currently is beyond words could explain. I kept my fingers crossed that I should not fall ill or claustrophobic in the bus.

I thanked all the bloggers and their wonderful reviews which were so helpful choose the bus and hotel I wanted to stay in.

I would be using the hotel only during the day to refresh and catch some sleep which I have been deprived of.

Koyembedu and travel from that super busy noisy bus stand was not new to me. I sat down waiting for my bus and remembered my college days of how reckless and daring I was to walk in to koyembedu buy a random ticket to Nagercoil and further take buses to Trivandrum.

Today in spite of all the planning I was worried,

The bus reminded me of a fish .Tall and sleek and way too silvery.

Even though these thoughts happen on my thought bubble I laugh out loud, followed by an embarrassment.

The sleeper was an upper berth and had sliding windows. The bus started to move and the air fought to gush in.

I didnt want to reach velaknni at 4.30.I prayed hard for a delay in departure contradicting to the prayers of fellow passengers.

I had a small talk with the bus driver and conductor and asked him if he could drop me  at amathakulama(this was the landmark the hotel reception gave me.

After a long halt at a toll before reaching Velankanni the bus pulls in to Velankanni by 5.30.The sun was out and I was a happy child. A proactive bus conductor asks for a couple of directions and drops me at VPN hotel in Matakulam or Our ladyas tank.

The bookings we done prior to my visit and they offered 10% discount plus complimentary breakfast after my sweet talk and enquiries.

The hotel was relatively new and the rooms were spotlessly clean .

I hit the bed and woke up at 8.30am.A quick shower and nibbled through a bit of everything on the buffet, took my camera and stood outside the hotel.

Being very enthusiastic and experimental that morning, I took a shortcut to walk to our ladyas tank.

I walked and walked through a dry dusty road with no signs of a tank. Occasionally there was a signage pointing to the direction I was walking to. I finally reached my destination. There were trees with cradles tied all over with bright yellow threads.

There was the tank with a metal covering and a cross and Hail Mary stencilled on it. I could look through the small holes and see a reflection of it in the water beneath.

I walked towards the Shrine of our lady of Good health and by then the sun was at its peak. Sipped from a bottle of water I was carrying and I could see devotees crawling towards the tank from the church as a belief. I saw an exhausted woman in the verge of collapsing on the sand. She drank water from my bottle and I proceeded to the church. There was a malayalam mass happening at that time and I took that as a sign from Mother Mary Welcoming me to her abode.

I sat on the floor outside as the church was full of Malayalam speaking devotees. Post the service I entered the church and I quickly tried to remember the names I had registered in my mind of people who needed special blessings.

I felt that I was pressurised to pray and not to forget.

I did my generalised template of prayer and prayed for My parents, grandparents, uncles ,aunts, cousins, their children, relatives, neighbours in all houses I have lived in, people I have met in all cities that I have lived in, my school, colleges, juniors , seniors , classmates, faculties, teachers, mentors, guides,doctors,people who are unwell, troubled, colleagues at work, bosses.

I have always found myself in a very difficult spot trying to pray in a busy church. I never get a Holy feeling or connect.

There is always suffering around.

Visited a museum near the church with pictorial depiction of how mother Mary appeared to the milk man .The church was founded its founding is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of Mary and Jesus to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the survival of Portuguese sailors assaulted by a violent sea storm.

I walked through the dirty crowded humid roads with fruit, shell, and pirated CD vendors and reached the beach.

The sipped some tender coconut water and clicked a few pictures of the ocean.

I ate raw mangoes and cashew apple.

The resinous cashew juice burnt my stomach as I walked back to where I could take a rickshaw back to the hotel. I ordered food to the room and slept. I was content that a long term dream came true and I was relaxed after the good sleep and food at the hotel.

I lay on the upper berth looking at the beautiful full moon from the window and the wind stroking my hair getting recaps of the day which has gone bya|in spirituality and relaxation. I would probably not want to go back to Velankanni but I have memories well etched.

I was in the drive thru line at Tim Horton's coffee shop about a week ago and when I got to the window to pay I didn't have to pay because the car in front of me had paid for my order.
I needed a deep color red  pair of shoes, I had purchased an outfit and I needed this particular color in order to go well with the dress, I went to so many stores as looking for this color online, would not be effective. After three hours of searching, I finally found the correct color and I was able to stop searching.
Itas a trip to Kanyakumari from Bangalore. Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of mainland India and is surrounded by three water bodies. Bay of Bengal towards east, Indian Ocean in south and Arabian Sea in west. I think it is the only place to see sun rise and sun set in water bodies in India. Kanyakumari town is named after the goddess Kanyakumari amman, a popular deity of the area. Legend has it that the goddess Parvathi in one of her incarnation as devi Kanya did penance on one of the rock of this landas end to obtain the hand of lord Siva. Tip of the day a Never ever wear any footwear which is difficult to open in Kanyakumari like sneakers or other shoes. Every place you visit, you have to open your shoe even in museum. 2nd tip of the day a Always wear socks to protect your feet from heat. 3rd tip a Protect yourself with best sunscreen lotion you have. 4th one a everybody speaks Hindi. 5th one a Hardly any non veg restaurant. Everyone is veg and I figured out only one non veg which became my favorite. Ok ok lots of free trip.

Its 22-March-2017 10:30 PM, we have boarded Nagercoil Express in Bangalore City Junction station. Since this train does not have any pantry, we had to get packed food. When I am traveling I am always double hungry than normal days. The train was full, but it was totally empty once it reached Madurai next day at 10:00 am. Runai and I were thinking whether the train will go till Nagercoil or not. Then I saw there was another family far end in the same coach.

We reached Nagercoil Junction station at 23-March-2012 2:30 pm. We came out of the station and saw lots of taxi waiting to take you to Kanyakumari. We know that they are going to take you on a ride if we hire them, so thought of taking a bus because it 20 KM from Nagercoil to Kanyakumari. There lots of local public bus very frequent to go to Kanyakumari. But then I came to know that it will take 2 hours to reach in this type of bus because it will go everywhere and will stop in every place. One person told us that if we walk a kilometer from there to reach highway, then we will get direct express bus for Kanyakumari and will take hardly 20 min to reach. Along with us there were another family who came to highway road bus stop. After waiting for 10 min, a bus came and we boarded that bus. Ticket was Rs. 18 per head and we reached Kanyakumari around 3:30 pm. We asked one fellow passenger to drop us in Kanyakumari Railway station. I had a printed google map of all the places from Kanyakumari Railway station. Anyway we got down and saw that itas the entrance for Our Lady of Ransom Church.

We decided to go to the church and then search for hotel. We did that promptly. Itas a beautiful church. A bit of information about this church a Located on the shoreline of the Bay of Bengal, the 100 year old Church in dedicated to Mother Mary. It was built in the Gothic style of architecture with a strong Portuguese influence. It is 153 feet high and is crowned with a cross of pure gold. One lady near the entrance asked me if I know Tamil and I replied yes. May be she knows only Tamil and wanted to communicate something important. She told me that behind the church, there is a staircase and on top there is a new smaller church build and we also get to see beautiful view of Bay of Bengal from the terrace. We opened our shoe and went inside the church. Interior was very simple just opposite to the decoration on outside. Then we went backstage and went to that new church which was pretty small and from the terrace we can see the beautiful sea. We could not take any picture because we did not yet open our luggage.

Next was our hotel search. Tell you something, if there are 100 houses for local resident, then there are 1000 hotels for tourist. So we decided to go near the beach and get a hotel. In the midway we found a budget Hotel Sangam. We wanted to enquire the rate and they told Rs. 1300 and 1000 for A/C and Non A/C double bed. We told its too much and we were about to leave and the receptionist told us, that they have room for Rs 600. Basically itas the same room and since it is off season, they lower the rate and I instantly booked it for 3 days. After refreshing we went to the restaurant downstairs. We did not wanted something fancy so ordered for 2 plates of lunch meal. Tell you something, I donat know what they gave in food but I till late night I was not hungry. So we decided that we are not going to go in that restaurant anymore.

We headed toward Triveny Sangam (which is the meeting point of three water bodies). I am confused here. Till now I know that there are 3 different Triveny Sangam (one near Srirangapatnam, another near Coorg and next is this one). If a traveler ask for Triveny Sangam details, where will the person refer to? Anyway itas a rocky place and no sea beach as such. There are plenty of shops for sea shells and they are pretty cheap AMO. Big shells were for Rs. 200 whereas in Chennai they are sold for min Rs. 500 for bad quality ones. We can have a so-so view for sun rise and sun set from here with lots of obstacles. After the sun set and few photographs, we left the place.
After celebrated alagar festival we went to thamukam ground to saw the exhibition with childrens then we went to shos on that ground and buy the cosmetic's items.

I purchased a new video game two weeks ago, "Mass effect" for my playstation. All of the reviews were pretty sub-par, but i figured i would give it a chance. To my surprise, not only was the game fun, but is something that i look forward to playing (at least for the now) quite a bit.

I've never met her in person but we have facetime each other, well we had an argument a week ago and she didn't talk to me for approximately 3 days and I really thought that was it until she facetime me last night!  I had the best feeling ever it was like going to your favorite ice cream place and ordering your favorite flavor, I felt warm inside.
One afternoon I was at the store. I saw a lot of traffic and people. I could hear the people saying, hurry up!aa I could smell junk food. I was feeling so happy because it was Halloween.

I was passing by the street and I saw this old lady who needed help. She was 61-years-old, as tall as a tree, and her shape was skinny. Her hair color was white as snow. Her skin color was white as well. Her eyes were brown. She had pink clothes. Her eyes seemed to be saying to help her cross the street.

People were crowding like an angry mob. Another thing I could see was people wearing their Halloween costumes like they couldnat wait to get their own hands on the candy.

Finally, it was late and all of the people went trick or treating. Then I helped the lady cross the street, so she could go buy candies. She went home to give out candy to the kids. Afterwards, she was happy that I helped her.
Shares i bought rise up to 5 %.

It was when I taught my Grand Mother to use my brand new iPad Pro and Apple Pencil and she was delighted to use it.One weekend, when I went to my home with my brand new iPad Pro and iPencil, I was curious to let my Grandma use it.That day, she was on her way to temple when I made her sit with me and taught few basic things of the iPad.My Grandma is wonderful brave and 76 years old lady, who successfully completed her 8th grade of those days (A great matter of fact in those days who was brought up by a Step Mother). At first, it was all fantasy for her. She refused to touch the screen or pencil. But, after a small demo that I showed, she volunteered herself to try it out.Here are some beautiful picture of hers trying this eraas gadget.The first thing she wrote in iPad is my Grandpaas name in Tamil .Then, she wrote all my family members name. I wonder she follows the order even in writing our names.
The surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letter box.  The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because I was out when they called they hadnat been able to leave it, so Iad have to go and pick it up from the parcel depot.  I was intrigued.  I hadnat ordered anything online, it wasnat my birthday, and I wasnat expecting anything exciting in the post at all.  I had no idea what it could possibly be.  The next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and collected the parcel.  It was a box, about the size of a shoe box, wrapped in a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company ablurta on it.  I was none the wiser, I didnt recognise the company and couldnat tell who it was from by the wrapping. 

I waited until I got home, and then I opened it.  The parcel contained a brown cardboard box which said 'Buddy Boxa on the outside.  Inside, was a collection of rather random, but very charming gift items.  They included a pair of socks made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasnat too sure about that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus plants, a asew your owna cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook!  There was still no card to say who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying aI saw this and thought of you!a  It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone, somewhere to cheer me up.  Iad had a rather bad time recently following a bereavement and losing my job as well, so Iad been quite down, knowing that someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a surprise, made me very happy.  The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a very recent surprise, but a lovely one.

A few weeks ago i was in town and I bumped into an old maths teacher of mine. For this Blog I will call her Mrs A. Mrs A is quite a pleasant lady who always had a big smile and hello for me, which is kind of surprising and makes me feel a bit guilty for some of my behaviours towards her when i was at school. Back then I hated all teachers, the authorities. For me they were the enemy and Iam sure they didnt think much of me either. I recognise that I didnt give teachers an easy time I lacked the empathy and understanding to recognise that many teachers were just trying to do their best to do their job.

That day in town Mrs A and I had an interesting conversation regarding ADHD. First of all we did the pleasantries, asking each other how we were, Mrs A explaining she had been retired for a number of years and then we briefly discussed how great it is to see the sun. In Co. Fermanagh it is always a topic of conversation if the sun comes out because it usually never stops raining.   Then Mrs A asked me what I was working at these days and I explained that I was a founding director of Adult ADHD NI an organisation set up to support Adults and families affected by ADHD etc. etc.. Mrs A said well done Niall, that sounds like good work your doing. Then brightly laughing she said isn't it funny in my day there was no ADHD we called them BOLD CHILDRENa

Well I was glad she said it because I went on to tell her the following story, perhaps not quite as detailed, but she got the idea. It was actually Mrs Aas class that gave me a greatest understanding of how my school had failed me due to lack of knowledge or willingness to support students with various needs.   It was in year 4 that i ended up in Mrs As math class. Mrs As math class was what ye called top maths at my school. The maths class for the brainy students, the students that got everything really easy and the students that automatically understood how a2 + b2 = c2. So what the hell was I doing there? I was still trying to work out when they started adding the alphabet to sums, I must have missed that day. The reason I was there was due to the teacher I had from the year before. For this Blog ill call her Mrs B.

Mrs B was my ultimate nightmare. From the very first moment I met her at the door of her classroom Mrs B was screaming at me. At that particular moment she had no reason to scream at me but I can only assume that she had heard from other teachers that I had been a handful and she was not for taking any nonsense. Nonsense was my speciality, if I couldnat be nonsensical I had no idea what my role was. She ordered me to sit right in front of her at the top of the class and the second I opened my mouth she was down on me like a ton of bricks.

I came into some money and got to buy some things I wanted.
I strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.

It is also nice to see the new inventions they create. I watched aThe True Cost" that makes me question and despise a lot of things in shops now. I can't help but get drawn in sometimes though. The shops market things in such a way it's hard to not enjoy shopping.

They make us want to buy things to improve our lives and feel loved. We/I need to remember that they are only material things. New clothes and furniture won't really change how people feel about us, once they get past the initial judgements.

One of the most counterintuitive pieces of advice I found is that to make yourself feel happier, you should help others. In fact, 100 hours per year.is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others in order to enrich our lives.As opposed to actually taking a holiday, it seems that planning a vacation or just a break from work can improve our happiness.

On a holiday, I was sitting in my room after finishing my home work. As my friends were away to hill stations, I was feeling very lonely. I watched the cars and other vehicles passing by and wished that like my friends, I would also have been travelling or passing my time.

While my mind was occupied with thoughts of holidays and having fun with my friends, the door bell rang. I ran to answer it and found the postman with a parcel and a letter for me.

I signed the paper and took the parcel. My hands were itching to open the packet as my curiosity knew no bounds. I ripped the parcel open and found a beautiful tape recorder in it. The parcel had been sent from the United States and the letter along with it was from my uncle who had sent me that wonderful gift.

However, even more joy than receiving the tape recorder was the letter which my uncle had written. The letter was an invitation to go to the United States for my holidays. My uncle had arranged everything for me-the tickets and the visa, and I already had a passport.

My heart skipped several beats as I ran to give this great news to my mother. She was taken aback initially and her first reaction was not so positive.

However, she thought about it, consulted my father who was at his office and they both agreed to allow me to go to the United States to spend the rest of my holidays with my uncle.

I jumped from room to room and started packing my clothes, my toys, my books and other articles that I would need on the flight and in America. My mind was filled with various ideas about how I would spend my time with my cousins. I started dreaming about Disney world, Universal studios, the Statue of Liberty, the Grand Canyon and all the other tourist attractions that I had read about in magazines.

My father took me shopping the same day because he felt that I would need some more things to take with me. We bought gifts for my cousins and my uncle and aunt and when I came back home my cupboard was full of new clothes, shoes, gifts, etc.

Since I had not expected any such thing to happen to me, and I had been feeling sorry for myself, this offer came as a great surprise. This was indeed the happiest day of my life and I don't think I shall ever forget it as long as I live.

Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.


During the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overjoyed to see and meet one another.

The following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.
The temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This "Queen of the Hill Stations" is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.

We went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle's car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Sam's Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.

The shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk saris', spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.

We also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.

strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.

 I would argue that these two tools, camera and video, play an integral part in different types of celebrations. First of all, most people have moments of their childhood and memories from childhood are captured in cameras. To illustrate, some of the most important events such as birthday parties, weddings, graduations and so on are included in these jigs and in this way the moment is captured and saved for a long period of time. Furthermore, as some essential and happy events are recorded, they could be used and displayed years later in order for some people to remember some significant events. A good illustration in my case is that on my 22nd birthday, my friends made me a really emotional video from all the years that we have been friends. Without the usage of the camera and video-recorder, this could never have happened.

By evening, everybody is in full spirits and would be out. We sometimes go for partying and enjoy a great deal over there. As time passes by everybody starts getting excited.

Each place would have a difference in their timings and accordingly the New Year would dawn. When it reaches almost midnight, the entire family would be out, bursting crackers, wishing each other and enjoying and welcoming the New Year. Churches would conduct midnight masses and most of the people would be attending masses to welcome a blessed and happy new year.

We all were 5 together; Ye Nandi is tall and slim girl, Aye Myat Khine is very small girl like a Thumbelina, Sett Lett Kg is a beautiful girl, May Chen is a cute girl, and I. On that day May Chen teased me all that way to the cafeteria. She still teasing me when we got to the cafeteria. When we got there we bought some snacks and drinks for us and looked around the cafeteria. We chatted with the other friends also. At that time the thing I had never expected to me. That was my friend, May Chen, teased me again and unfortunately my Longyi fall down. Longyi is our traditional skirt. The cloth is often sewn into a cylindrical shape. It is worn around the waist, running to the feet. It is held in place by folding fabric over, without a knot. It is also sometimes folded up to the knee for comfort. Similar garments are found in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Malay Archipelago, and Juiz de Fora. Everyone was looking at me and laughing at me. At that time I don't know what I have to do. My face was red like a tomato because of my shyness. So I picked up my Longyi and dressed up my self and run straight to the class and cried a lot.

I took my cat Tommy to the vet last month because he had been able to eat for several weeks.  It was the same problem he had in November last year. the vet said he had an abscess in his mouth that was causing the pain which resulted in his inability to eat.  They took xrays and tests and gave him a steroid shot, etc.  I did not get the results or cause, but my cat was better (or so I thought).  It cost me $800 and being unemployed, it took me 3 months to pay back the loan i had gotten in order to pay for the vet bill.  Then in march, Tommy started having the same issue.  It had been 3 weeks since he had eaten much of anything. He was withering away before me and I was terrified he was going to die. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have the another $800 to take him back to the vet and I couldn't borrow again.  So I began an email campaign to the owner of the vet in order to get him to help Tommy and no cost or some type of low fee. It took more than a week but he finally called and said to bring Tommy in.  He gave Tommy a shot and some medicine and said that his abscess was benign.  Now Tommy is doing just fine.  I was/am so happy.  Without an option to pay, I was certain I would have had no option but to put him down.  But thanks to a little persuasion, a kind vet and the grace of god, Tommy is still here today to play with little kitty.  Tommy, little kitty and I are all very happy.

  after attending my sister's high school graduation I left to spend a month of summer vacation with my grandparents. I wasn't sure about the trip because while I liked them a lot I'd never spent much time alone with them. I packed everything I could think of to keep me entertained on the long trip from Florida to Oklahoma.

Though hard as it is to believe I had so much fun on their motor home. Granted most of the time I was sleeping, reading, or listening to music. Those things can only hold your attention for so long so in those periods of boredom I would talk with my grandma.

She told the funny stories involving my mom as a little kid that sounded more like the trouble I would get myself into rather than anything she would have done. Tales of other relatives that had done some strange or suspicious things, thing such as one's husband mysteriously dying or fishing trips that didn't include fishing. I'd never heard most of this because my mother has a bad memory.

We even laughed at the things she remembered me doing when I was little. Like blowing the surprise for my dad by asking mom where the necklace dad had bought her was.On our way to Oklahoma we stopped in Little Rock Arkansas to see the Bill Clinton Presidential library and Museum. The place was made mostly of glass so it had an amazing futuristic look to it.

It held everything from Clinton's life story to what was taking place in America during his time in office and what affect he had on it.

Grandma was constantly worrying if I had enough to eat and if my cloths needed to be washed. I told not to worry about me that I was fine but she wouldn't believe me. While I was there I also meet her brother Sid.

He was great; I liked him a lot, probably because as grandma said I'm just like him.After being there for two weeks we again loaded up the motor home and headed up to Oklahoma City. We went to the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum.

The grieving people put up pictures and flowers along the gate that ran surrounded it. While two huge black walls stood on either end of a pool of water. Each wall held a time on it symbolizing the start and stop time of the bombing, 9:01 and 9:03. Then to represent those lost gold chairs where placed in a roped of field, mini chairs were used to distinguish the lost adults from the children. It was sad to imagine that the number of chairs could hold the number of people gone in a split second.The next week I spend hanging around doing nothing. Then the last week of my visit my oldest sister Courtney flew up to spend a week with us then take me home. With her there it was even more fun. The three of us would talk all day about things. Then finally the trip was over, Courtney and I got on a plan home. Which went over just fine until the lay over in Dallas. The weather was bad that day and the screen told us our flight was cancelled. So we exited the airport to get another ticket. Yet when we finally got to the counter the lady told us it wasn't cancelled, that they had made a mistake with the monitors. So that was a relief except that the plane was about to leave and we had to go back through security. After all that we finally got on the plane just in time. That's how I spent half of my summer vacation.

I spent almost a month with great anxiety regarding my result publication. I started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could hardly keep away the tensions about my upcoming result. The result was so important that my college admission would mostly depend on it. I could not sleep well in the night before the result publishing. I think this is a common anxiety for students and I was familiar with this type of anxiety. However, this particular exam results game me more nightmares than any other time of my life.
The result was published at around 11.00 am and I found that I did exceptionally well. I was so relieved and happy that I literally shouted. Then I hurriedly came back to our home and gave the news to my parents. They were happy too. My father bought sweets and my mother gave it to our neighbours. I felt excited, happy and relieved.

Nearly 50,000 candidates are vying for the position of mayor, deputy mayor, ward chairman and ward member in 283 local municipalities.

The ballot paper in the capital Kathmandu - one of the largest constituencies - was around one metre long to accommodate the 878 candidates.

The vote has been split into two phases because of unrest in the southern plains bordering India, where the minority Madhesi ethnic group is refusing to participate until an amendment to the constitution is passed.
The remaining four provinces, considered potential flashpoints for election-related violence, will vote in the second phase due to be held on June 14.

The pursuit of happiness is so crucial that we try a lot of motivational strategies to make our employees productive. Happy employees tend to work efficiently and effectively since they emit positive energy, it is for this reason why they have to have proper compensation in order for them to enjoy and love their respective job. If the employee is in the state of being happy, he/she is thrice innovative. These 25 little things can really make them feel important and they'll be dedicated to their respective work.

One afternoon I was at the store. I saw a lot of traffic and people. I could hear the people saying, "Hurry up!'' I could smell junk food. I was feeling so happy because it was Halloween.

I was passing by the street and I saw this old lady who needed help. She was 61-years-old, as tall as a tree, and her shape was skinny. Her hair color was white as snow. Her skin color was white as well. Her eyes were brown. She had pink clothes. Her eyes seemed to be saying to help her cross the street.

People were crowding like an angry mob. Another thing I could see was people wearing their Halloween costumes like they couldn't wait to get their own hands on the candy.

Finally, it was late and all of the people went trick or treating. Then I helped the lady cross the street, so she could go buy candies. She went home to give out candy to the kids. Afterwards, she was happy that I helped her.
It was when I taught my Grand Mother to use my brand new iPad Pro and Apple Pencil and she was delighted to use it.One weekend, when I went to my home with my brand new iPad Pro and iPencil, I was curious to let my Grandma use it.That day, she was on her way to temple when I made her sit with me and taught few basic things of the iPad.My Grandma is wonderful brave and 76 years old lady, who successfully completed her 8th grade of those days (A great matter of fact in those days who was brought up by a Step Mother). At first, it was all fantasy for her. She refused to touch the screen or pencil. But, after a small demo that I showed, she volunteered herself to try it out.Here are some beautiful picture of hers trying this era's gadget.The first thing she wrote in iPad is my Grandpa's name in Tamil .Then, she wrote all my family members name. I wonder she follows the order even in writing our names.
The surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letter box.  The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because I was out when they called they hadn't been able to leave it, so I'd have to go and pick it up from the parcel depot.  I was intrigued.  I hadn't ordered anything online, it wasn't my birthday, and I wasn't expecting anything exciting in the post at all.  I had no idea what it could possibly be.  The next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and collected the parcel.  It was a box, about the size of a shoe box, wrapped in a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company 'blurt' on it.  I was none the wiser, I didn't recognise the company and couldn't tell who it was from by the wrapping. 

I waited until I got home, and then I opened it.  The parcel contained a brown cardboard box which said 'Buddy Box' on the outside.  Inside, was a collection of rather random, but very charming gift items.  They included a pair of socks made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasn't too sure about that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus plants, a 'sew your own' cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook!  There was still no card to say who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying 'I saw this and thought of you!'  It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone, somewhere to cheer me up.  I'd had a rather bad time recently following a bereavement and losing my job as well, so I'd been quite down, knowing that someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a surprise, made me very happy.  The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a very recent surprise, but a lovely one. 
A few weeks ago i was in town and I bumped into an old maths teacher of mine. For this Blog I will call her Mrs A. Mrs A is quite a pleasant lady who always had a big smile and hello for me, which is kind of surprising and makes me feel a bit guilty for some of my behaviours towards her when i was at school. Back then I hated all teachers, the authorities. For me they were the enemy and I'm sure they didn't think much of me either. I recognise that I didn't give teachers an easy time I lacked the empathy and understanding to recognise that many teachers were just trying to do their best to do their job.

That day in town Mrs A and I had an interesting conversation regarding ADHD. First of all we did the pleasantries, asking each other how we were, Mrs A explaining she had been retired for a number of years and then we briefly discussed how great it is to see the sun. In Co. Fermanagh it is always a topic of conversation if the sun comes out because it usually never stops raining.   Then Mrs A asked me what I was working at these days and I explained that I was a founding director of Adult ADHD NI an organisation set up to support Adults and families affected by ADHD etc. etc.. Mrs A said "well done Niall, that sounds like good work your doing". Then brightly laughing she said "isn't it funny in my day there was no ADHD we called them BOLD CHILDREN"

Well I was glad she said it because I went on to tell her the following story, perhaps not quite as detailed, but she got the idea. It was actually Mrs A's class that gave me a greatest understanding of how my school had failed me due to lack of knowledge or willingness to support students with various needs.   It was in year 4 that i ended up in Mrs As math class. Mrs As math class was what ye called top maths at my school. The maths class for the brainy students, the students that got everything really easy and the students that automatically understood how a2 + b2 = c2. So what the hell was I doing there? I was still trying to work out when they started adding the alphabet to sums, I must have missed that day. The reason I was there was due to the teacher I had from the year before. For this Blog ill call her Mrs B.

Mrs B was my ultimate nightmare. From the very first moment I met her at the door of her classroom Mrs B was screaming at me. At that particular moment she had no reason to scream at me but I can only assume that she had heard from other teachers that I had been a handful and she was not for taking any nonsense. Nonsense was my speciality, if I couldn't be nonsensical I had no idea what my role was. She ordered me to sit right in front of her at the top of the class and the second I opened my mouth she was down on me like a ton of bricks.
